353	1	This place is swamped but well worth the wait... People can knock on this place but lets be honest they make damn good food and the portions are definitely some of the largest you can eat.    If you show up and the place is banana's (btw banana latte is legit) then try to check in and flirt at the bar and you might get lucky and seat yourself without the wait (your are welcome).  The meat loaf is crazy good, there are a few options of having it, I have owned some and they are tasty.  The Chicken and waffles are amazing!  Love coming back to this place when I can.
1866	1	Oh my goodness!  We drove here under recommendation of a friend.  It is amazing!   Non descript little strip mall on the edge of town.  When we pulled into the parking lot at 12pm,  patrons were doing nothing short of running to the door to claim their table.  The crispy rice appetizer was a rocket fire explosion of flavors.  We had the Tom Kah Kai soup, Pad Se-Ew with chicken, Crispy Duck with Chili Mint Leaves, all washed down with Thai Iced Tea and Singha and finished off with the delicious banana roll with coconut ice cream for dessert.  As my dearly departed father would have said, "this meal was a religious experience!"  Highly recommended!
1929	1	I had to update, because we've been back several times since my last review. They've really turned the trashy counter situation around. It's like 95% squeaky clean now, which is great. The pizza continues to be awesome. We have never had to wait for more than a few minutes. I look forward to friends coming to town because that means we get to go to Secret Pizza. Happily upgrading to five stars!
30	0	They have different sections of food, mexican, american, italian, chinese but not a big selection of each. And the food isnt the best. We went there bc of the unlimited beer, but it was only bud light and some other beer. It was too pricy for the selection if u ask me. $37 for dinner.
1501	0	Food was so bad my daughter threw up and we all have the runs, the chicken served was more than just pink, not only that but it was ALL very blan. I have had MUCH better... So don't believe all the hype, and so not worth the 1 1/2 hour wait..... This place should be called the stable, because all of the mess and pigs that go there and eat the slop. It was very uncomfortable sitting under the bright lights and witness the mess.... What a disappointment !!!!!!
384	1	Had the Hawaii Maui steak and it was freaking delicious. Cooked and seasoned perfectly. My friend had the burger and salad which was also good. Great place to eat if you don't want to spend too much money on the strip and still have a good late night meal
463	0	Our room was outdated at least 20 years. All the carpets throughout the halls were terribly stained. Our tv did not work, nor did our phone. Could not call for room service. Had to call out to some nasty Italian food place. Couldn't even sign in to their promised wifi. No one seemed to care!!! Oh yea, plus a resort fee of $15.00 per day! And tax on top of that!!!???!!!  This place is far from a resort. The pool needs to be dug up and resized to accommodate the amount of people and hotel size ratio! I had really looked forward to this little get away, kick back and get a tan. So much for that, very non-appealing....no space! This place is a dive!!!
42	1	Absolutely love this place!! I loved the concept of an Asian fusion and everything I ate was delicious! A little upset I came in while somewhat hungover, thanks to open bar at Senor Frogs. I didn't finish my food cause my stomach was still a little upset. BUT, it was BOMB!  Husband and I shared the fried chicken wings. I'm telling you, you'd be a fool not to order them. Best wings I've ever had!! We also shared the salt and pepper garlic fries. Again.. The best ever!!  I ordered the Miyagi-San burger with grilled onions instead of onion rings. The meat was flavored SO WELL and I loved the over easy fried egg.  My husband ordered the Kiki burger and I swear I looked down at my food, then up at his and it was gone. That good!!!
703	0	The line to pay and then to be seated on a Saturday (07/12/14) night around 7pm was not bad at all. As far as the food goes I had some really impressive salads (a fruit one comes to mind). I liked the entree options but nothing was that memorable. Pretty standard Vegas buffet food.  The one problem that I was that my boyfriend added on the all you can drink (wine, beer, etc) option. We each ordered a beer (he was brought the wrong one, but just decided to drink it), his second he finally got the one he wanted, but this is where it went bad. He went to get another plate of food so I ordered his 3rd beer for him. It took 30+ minutes to get it which included being brushed off at the cashier station and then having to get the manager involved. The manager said he would talk to the waitress, but no real action was taken. I never went back up to try any of the deserts because I was at the table hoping we would get our drinks while he was having to actually leave the table to get served. I even contacted them when we got home and was told that they would give me a priority reservation the next time I went to the buffet.   My advice is if you eat there do not add the all you can drink option. I don't know if they only want to allow you to have 2, then they should call it $11.99 for 2 drinks. I am sure people would still order that.   There are a lot of options in Vegas so I will not be returning to this buffet. I may never stay at this hotel because of the level of non-customer service that we received which is a shame because it was an option for our upcoming trip.
301	0	I was real stoked to hear that White Castle opened up on the strip. And since we were gonna be in town for the big fight weekend, I was hyping up getting a crave case at some point during the weekend. Good thing it's open 24 hours but its location is a little tricky in that you really have to be in the immediate area and just walk over because it's smack dab in the middle of the strip by Harrah's and across the street from the Mirage... I was bummed to find out that this particular White Castle location does not offer the bacon-cheese slider or the jalapeno one. LAME. The bacon and cheese one is so good. Whenever one of my relatives flies to LA from Queens they bring a crave case of that goodness but none in Vegas?? That alone is worth the deduction of 2 stars.  We got there after spending a few hours at Omnia nightclub and were all starving. Luckily the line wasnt too long. We only waited about 10-15 mins before we ordered. As soon as we sat down, the line was crazy... We ordered a crave case. That's 30 sliders. We got half classic and the other 15 with cheese. We got 4 orders of large fries and sodas. The sodas are refillable so that's good. The crinkle cut fries are decent. Some are crispy. Others were a little soggy. The sliders which I was so looking forward to were a little disappointing. Not because bacon wasnt an option but they just didnt taste as good as I remember. The weird thing was the original ones without the cheese were tastier than the ones WITH cheese. They seemed to have way more of the grilled/steamed onions on the originals than the cheese slider. The difference in taste was significant. And I was pretty disappointed... Dont get me wrong. I still scarfed down about 6 of them bad boys but I had no choice, I was starving. But I was still disappointed because I couldnt figure out how the sliders hand-carried on the plane ride from Queens and reheated in the microwave were better than the ones right off the grill in front of me. Puzzling... I hope it improves because if someone like me whose "lightly" familiar with the White Castle menu is disappointed, what more for someone that's a tried & true Craver. Harold & Kumar would not approve...  Funny story... As we were finishing up. A slightly tipsy and partied-out couple who didnt want to wait in the long line for their food offered us $10 for 2 sliders... SOLD. To the lush couple... Only in Vegas.  Service was ok. Definitely no enthusiasm from the cashier that helped us. Theyre probably over it with the characters they see on the daily... Be better White Castle Las Vegas. You should be better than that.  ps - cousins from Queens brought over a crave case a couple of weeks after this trip and sure enough, they were tastier. taste comparison complete... I was right. Vegas needs to step it up.
879	1	The food was great, huge portions.  We couldn't finish our plates.  The presentation was excellent complete with sage and twigs.  The service was great, Robert P. was very helpful with the menu.  Seeing that Man Vs Food and the New York Times liked the Sage Chicken, I had to give it a try, and it didn't dissapoint.  They also have a great wall of fame at the entrance.
837	1	Drunk food at its best! This little gem is hidden in Cosmo. Came here after a crazy night at Marquee. I was actually surprised the line wasn't longer but there was still a good amount of people. Line moves quick so no worries.   Pizza slices are about $5 but really depends what you get. I tried the White Pizza and the Pepperoni and they were both amazing. My favorite one was the White Pizza. Not sure if I was just drunk and hungry or if the pizza was just THAT good.
669	0	Ambience was nice, food and service not so much.   I ordered the "live well" omelet. The egg whites were fluffy but the lobster was nearly non existent. Every time I thought I saw a piece, it turned out to be a tomato. Asparagus was plentiful.   The "fruit" it comes with is cantaloupe only, even tho their description of mixed fruit includes berries and seasonal fruit. Cantaloupe is literally the only fruit I don't like (I'm not a picky eater). When asked if I can get a different fruit the answer was honeydew or cantaloupe ONLY. Then it should say it's served with melon, not fruit. The waiter was also not accommodating when my husband asked for onions on his hash browns, saying they already come with onions. We didn't see any.   On the upside we had a beautiful view of the gardens and the coffee was good. A better server could've changed our experience.
1097	1	It's no secret that I'm not really a fan of pizza but once I tried the ones here... Oooooohhhh man... I'm in love! Every bite tastes like heaven. I had the cheese w/ mushroom pizza and my belly was dancing in joy! My husband and I loved it so much that we purposely forgot our diet and went for another round!
1280	0	Honestly not impressed. I've heard so much hype about their food and it really was no different then the cafeteria that is at my university. also, they messed up my order. i understand that times can get busy, but when i show up and there are only 4 people in line i would hope i can get the right order. Also, I'm not sure how good i feel about eating chicken that is in the shape of a ring LOL,  something tells me chickens don't grow like that.
323	0	Not a fan of buffets but people I was with wanted to go. Breakfast buffet $18.99 Friday morning, $21.99 on Saturday. I piled a plate but it still isn't worth those prices. I recommend you turn yourself around and go have a freshly made breakfast at the Backstage Deli tucked in a corner of the casino floor at Luxor, near the ticket area for Criss Angel's Believe. Way cheaper, tastier, made to order, and more enjoyable.  The More buffet is 2 sided. Both sides are not quite the same. If you are still going to get the buffet, I highly recommend you head straight to the Omelet station and have the chef make you a fresh omelet because the eggs on the buffet are watery and tasteless. Then you have Brown 'n Serve sausage and bacon. Cheese blintz with blueberry sauce, apple pie filling crepes, biscuits, southern white gravy, home fries, grits, mini pancakes, french toast, corned beef hash. I tried a little of everything the first day. Much of it seems frozen/packaged/heat & serve.  Day 2 I went right to the highlights: Omelet, corned beef hash was REALLY good, add some country gravy on top, lots of bacon, and if you try something sweet go ahead and dump a ladle of the blueberry sauce on it.  Fresh fruit, salads, and mediteranean dips on the center aisle.  On weekends they use 1 side for a few more lunch style hot dishes to make it "brunch" plus chilled shrimp, muscles, crawfish and 2 types of sushi, one was plain cucumber, the other looked like California Roll. Go ahead and skip all that nonsense. Unless your plan is to just take an empty plate up to the chilled shrimp display and go hog wild on it. Then maybe its worth those prices....nah. Still isn't.
1144	1	Shake Shack delivers!  Ok.....not like to your home, but they surely do provide FLAVOR and SATISFACTION!  I have been dying to try Shake Shack since my fiance visited Las Vegas without me a few months ago, and was so glad to finally squeeze in some time to stop here on our recent visit.  I ordered the Shack Stack, which is a combination of their vegan burger (stuffed portobello mushroom) on top of their signature patty.  Don't judge me....it was my first experience so I wanted to GO BIG!  My boo insisted on ordering their cheese fries and you know I don't argue when it comes to cheese. *heart eye emoji*  For a busy night on the strip, we didn't wait TOO long.  Our burgers were ready in about 5-10 minutes.  I mean, they have a whole army behind the counter cooking!  The portobello mushroom was fried nicely and had a great crispy outer layer, while still remaining moist inside.  The cheese filled center was absolutely delicious!  Crinkle cut fries are my favorite.  Cover it with a creamy cheese sauce and I am a happy girl!  Finally, their house made shandy was the perfect touch for enjoying our burgers in the hot Las Vegas heat!    The prices are kind of high, but for a restaurant on the strip it's reasonable.  Don't plan to share - portion sizes are just enough.
428	1	My wife and I know breafast fare, and we think Bouchon is the best anywhere, bar none.  Yesterday morning was our second visit to Bouchon - the first was a couple years ago.  The setting feels elegant and calm, in stark contrast to manic hustle of the Las Vegas Strip.  My wife ordered the Quiche du Jour, which yesterday was a quiche florentine (spinach and cheese), served with a simple salad of lightly dressed greens.  I had the Croque Madame (toasted ham & cheese on brioche with a fried egg & mornay sauce) which was served with more french fries than I deserved.  Seriously, Chef, you can pull back on the volume of fries.  But everything, from the complimentary bread served with butter and incredible jam, to the perfect quiche to the wonderful croque, was FANTASTIC.  Highly recommend.  Only criticism was they were a bit snooty when my wife and I tried to swing by for lunch the day before - seems strange that they say they are open for lunch but close at 1 pm.  Regardless, we can't wait to come back.
1716	1	I had lunch there last week and it is still one of my all-time favorites.  Salmon burger with sweet potato fries is always topnotch.  Salmon portion seemed to be a bit thicker than usual but it was cooked perfectly.  It is one of the best cuts of salmon I have had at any restaurant.  Sweet potato fries were crispy and also some of the better ones I have had.  Lunch with 2 beers was less than $20 - great value.  By the way, sit at the bar if you can.  It often makes for interesting conversation.
233	0	We originally wanted to go eat at P.F. Chang's but it was an hour wait so we decided on this place instead.  Maybe we should have taken it as a sign that there was a reason this place had no wait.  The food is pretty expensive for the meagre size portions you get.  We ordered pad thai, potstickers, lettuce chicken wraps (I was craving this when I thought we were gonna go eat at P.F. Chang's), sweet and sour pork, and wonton soup.  They ended up bringing by a wrong order so they just let us keep it.  Service was ok but a little slow.  They never refilled our waters.  I guess if you want something quick and you're staying at Planet Hollywood then it's convenient.  Otherwise I wouldn't bother stopping here.
801	1	AWESOME find.  One of those,  how did we get there? Im so glad we found this place, kind of experiences for my group of 4.  Service was great- our waiter was funny, attentive and CRAZY fast.  We shared a few plates including the shishito peppers, octopus balls (not the best but not bad), onion rings ( AMAZING, we should have ordered 4 orders instead of 1) and we each got a noodle bowl or a burger for our mains.  Broth was delish of my noodles and the noodles were good, but the chewier ramen from the dish with the XO sauce had better texture.  Pork belly pieces were like bits of porky heaven- honestly it was very memorable and delicious.  Cannot stress enough how good the onion rings were.  As a bit of a onion ring connoisseur I have to say they rank at the top of my lifetime list, and they were incredible inexpensive.  MUST GO BACK!  You need to go and try this place out, now :)
1655	1	Don't go to In and Out or Fatburger, Come Here!    Hell, you could even have dinner here one night instead of going to a "fancier" establishment.  This will be one of the best burgers you will ever have in your lifetime.  Go straight for the Kobe Burger!  But there are plenty of other items to pick from if you want to spend less or try something else.  You can build your burger however you see fit.  You get to pick not only your preferred cheese of course but also the type of bread and there are MANY toppings to pick from.  Not too many places let you put avocado on top of a burger.  Wash it down with a beer, a float, or one of their shakes.  You might find this menu much more useful than what you will find on the listed website.  It really will give you an appreciation for the toppings and other items like sweet potato fries.   http://www.usmenuguide.com/burgerbarmenu.htm  I wish I didn't have to go to Las Vegas to eat here.  Yes, the decor is very Fox and Houndish but the food is worth it.
1365	0	I'm a buffet nut and have been to enough buffets to know when an establishment is a ripoff. I wish somebody wrote about this. Maybe people have different standards or they don't know any better and actually consider this buffet good. This place is terrible, especially for $87 -- 2 adults, 1 child, Monday night, an hour wait. Poor selection. Food doesn't taste good at all. Lots of plates empty and not being refilled. Do not eat here!!
1523	1	I had to write an update to my review of Holstein's because it was even better the second time around!  Everything from start to finish was amazing, and we ordered a lot of stuff.  Even the complimentary popcorn tasted great and was not as over saturated with oil as my first visit here.  What really stole the show for me though was the Rising Sun burger.  It was the best thing that I ate in Vegas during my most recent visit, and I am salivating just thinking about it as I write this review.  I also shared sides of sweet potato fries, onion rings, and fried pickles with my wife, and I loved them all.  I was so glad that we came back to eat at Holstein's again when we were in Las Vegas, because it was my favorite meal of our trip.  I can't wait to come back here again soon!
95	1	Most foodies know about the legendary Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas. All I can say is this...the curry here (specifically the Panang) is BY FAR the most exquisite Thai curry I have ever had. The nuance, the balance and subtlety of the flavors is incomparable. I've never had anything I didn't love and I've been going here for almost 15 years, but the Panang curry is truly a masterpiece of culinary excellence.
1571	1	How about dat dough?! Wow, watching them do work on the pizza dough was impressive, which made the pizza really impressive! The pizza chefs are pretty legit there.  There was not a long line (just about 5 people in front) when I went (around 7:30PM). A friend of mine recommends me the place cause she knows what Vegas is all about! It took a long time to make the whole pizza pie for 3 people to share though (35 mins), but it was definitely worth the wait. Waiting was not so hard, it's good to walk around and do something else around (gamble). ;)   The pepperoni and meatball are delicious toppings, and the center of the pizza was magnificent. That first bite has the perfect ratio of tomato sauce and cheese, then as you eat towards the crust more cheese! The dough was so good that I ate everything! I normally don't eat the crust but it was really that good to me.   I'm not a huge critic on pizza like I don't really pay so close of attention to how they make it, but I have eaten pizza around NYC like Grimaldi's and Lombardi's. I have a bigger heart for this place. :)
1105	0	The atmosphere is decent here. I came in with a group of 9 girls and after waiting an hour we were seated on a fairly empty patio.   The food here was just really not good. I had the fried eggs Benedict and eating it was a chore. If I weren't starving and already seated I would have walked over to McDonald's. Between the 9 of us, we passed around each plate trying to find an edible bite. It was a challenge. We also had an order of the French toast and it was a burnt loaf of bread... Save your money and blow it at some other Vegas joint.  And GOD FORBID you want a water. You'd have to lick out of the toilet or go to the fountains at Caesars.
1228	0	Our servers were nice but everything else, not so much. Had to wait forever for a seat. We were told 25-30 mins. But it was closer to 45-50 mins. Once we got a seat, we had to ask to move because we were by a back door where people kept entering and the wind was just making it a pain. Food was bland and took a while. Burgers were burnt and the bun on mine just fell apart to the point that I just gave up even eating it. This was our first experience here, and most likely our last.
9	0	Ordered Baja fish tacos and the shrimp and pork gyoza. The fish tacos were fine, nothing special one way or the other. The filling inside the gyoza was completely undercooked. As in it looked like the filling was tuna ceviche not cooked pork. Disgusting. They brought a new batch which was properly cooked but didn't even offer to take the charge off the bill. Never coming back. Mediocre at best. I'm just thankful I cut into that dumpling before popping the whole thing in my mouth or I would probably be very sick right now...
371	1	Frankenstein's monster was made out of bits and pieces of unrelated human beings.  So if Frankenstein's monster was staying at Mandalay Bay, where would he eat?   The Burger Bar, where you can have a hamburger made out of seemingly unrelated ingredients.  Kobe beef, lamb, fois gras, lobster, black truffles and avocado are just scratching the surface of the mismatched concoctions that come alive at the Burger Bar.  This isn't a buffet table loaded with burger toppings, but made to order concoctions of your own design (though they do have some pre-designed burgers to choose from).  The creative genius doesn't end with the burgers though.  A selection of Beer Floats are available as well.  That's right - Beer Float.  Ice cream and Beer.  We're no longer serving Mary Shelley's Frankenstien and now serving Mel Brook's Young Frankenstein.  And that's not all bad.  When my wife pointed out the Beer Floats, she laughed.  Unflinching, I immediately ordered the Beer Float sampler.  5 different micro-brew style beers, with 5 different flavors of ice cream.  I have to admit, most of them tasted better than I thought they would, and my wife who mocked me for ordering them was also slurping them down (I don't ever need 5 scoops of ice cream).  While I cannot say that the Beer Floats are the best beverage I've ever had, I can say that it was offered.  The burger however, was one of the best burgers I've ever had (second only to Detroit's Miller's Bar).  The Burger Bar is a 3-star setting with 4-star prices and superior burger options.  Strap it to a table, expose to lightning, and you have a place that even a monster could love.
390	0	Horrible.  In the dungeon of the pyramid.  Went for breakfast but the food was bad.  I bit into a sausage and thought it tasted funny.  I wondered if it was turkey but it was super bitter.  Green inside apparently they don't check the food before they reheat it and serve it.   I told the only staff member i saw and the response was "oh". Not sorry not oh my god where did you get it from.  Nothing.  I live in Nevada bTW
997	1	Pro: Cheesecake factory done right, TONS of seats, great food, excellent breakfast buffet. 24 hours!!!  Con: Back of the Venetian, can still be crowded during major conventions.  This is it, skip all your buffets and $150 dollar per person meals, come here and dine. The menu is long and detailed, from small to epic portions, everything is done right from 6 am to 9 pm. I have personally ate here 3 times while in those ungodly hours and everything is just done to perfection.   The breakfast buffet is a quick service option, most time is when my crew are here for CES, skip the wait, and go get your own food. The fruit is always the highlight, it's just better than the $33 dollars Caeser/Aria buffet.   If the place is packed, go eat at the bar, the service there is sometimes better.
373	0	I stayed here last month and this hotel is definitely a "you get what you pay for" hotel.  It's very small compared to the gigantors surrounding it. You can stand at one end of the casino and see the other end very clearly.  Their giftshop by the entrance seemed to never be open.  The room I stayed in had one power outlet and it wasn't by the desk.  The bathroom door didn't fit through the door frame for some reason so it wasn't able to shut.  The air conditioner didn't work but I didn't mind.    I gave a star for the room service ladies and gents.  They were always greeting me and offered towels galore.  The second star is for their mini 24/hr convenience store located by the elevators and pool entrance.  Everything you need is in there.    Speaking of the pool, it doesn't look like what it does in some of the yelp photos.  I think they renovated it and now it's just two pools. The waterfall and two "mini" pools are gone.   Overall, if you're on a budget and want to splurge on other things and just need a place to sleep, this is it.
1122	1	The best brunch on the strip!!!  Since they don't take reservations for brunch but recommend coming in earlier to avoid longer wait, I along with my friends got there around 9:30 and were seated within a few mins.  From the first moment you step on you can feel the cheerful/bright ambiance. Service, decor, and creativity all are bound to win your heart.  The food is definitely authentic french and hence even the French toast aren't the traditional ones you get at the American brunch restaurants. Not to say it was anything short of delicious.  Overall I had a great time and can't wait to get back for round 2 the next time I'm in that city.
1363	1	I did not know why people were raving about this joint until we were seated, served and tried the food. Wow!! The food was awesome, from appetizers to the hamburgers.    We arrived around 9 PM Friday night. After a ten minutes wait we were seated. Our waiter (Jerry) was professional, polite and took his time with us on deciding on our drinks. He gave us the I Pad which had the drinks menu and browsed all the different drinks they have. After ordering our drinks we went ahead and ordered food.  THE APPETIZERS:  -Truffle Parmesan Fries--@$11.00 Hand cut fries, truffle parmesan, truffle salt, truffle aioli, They cam in a cone shaped paper and they were delicious.  - Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings--@$9.00 these were just fantastic. Nicely fried, served in a Cone accompanied Chipotle Ketchup and ranch cheddar dip.  -Roasted Jalapeo Poppers--@$12.00 this was our favorite of all appetizers. They are served in a glass platter divided in 6 compartment each holding one popper with  Cheddar bacon, cheddar ranch sauces on the bottom of each one for dipping.   THE BURGERS:  - Farm Burger-- I had this one with additional beef patty. This was topped with duck breast bacon, cheddar cheese and fried egg. I asked for mine to be cooked Medium rare but got it around the medium. Still, the beef was so tasty in every bite I took. The duck bacon was flavorful and the eggs yolk oozing down was and extra addition of flavor combined with the aged cheddar cheese. 5 stars for sure. - Farm Burger--my friend had the same with only one patty. He thought In and out was great and when he tasted this one he was blown away.  -  Southern Yardbird Burger--This is what my friend had and she loved it.  Chicken burger, sharp cheddar, mustard bbq sauce, pickle and butter lettuce. -  Earth Burger (no meat)--My daughter is Vegan and she enjoyed this creation of this veggie style burger. Grilled portobello mushroom, fontina cheese, arugula and roasted tomato.  THE SHAKE:  After having such a big meal we did not think we have enough room for anything else. Then when our waiter Jerry suggested we try one at least, we decided to go with the Caramel Pudding Shake. Oh boy Oh boy Oh boy...we all shared this one, It was huge and let me tell you we all loved it so much. So rich and thick YOU MUST TRY IT.  We really enjoyed the GRB experience. This is one of my stops for burger and shake in Vegas.  Be sure to show your Harrah's playing card to get discount.  This whole dinner with three beers and two cocktails including tax came to $162.00. I say it was not bad at all.
1352	0	Stayed here for a convention.  It was about $130/nt.  Could have gotten a nicer room on the strip for less, and caught a car or the monorail.  Some of the rooms have been remodeled, some haven't.  There's no difference in rate.   Then there's the joy of being nickled and dimed for everything.  Internet (for a hotel that caters to conventioneers, who are there for work usually) cost like $15/day.  Gym facilities? $20/day.  I get it.  People are there for work, work is paying, who cares if you add another surcharge?  I care.  I will not stay here again - too many better options abound.  I was excited to stay in a Hilton hotel.  It didn't live up to the brand.
1744	0	This buffet was mediocre. We only ate here because we had a coupon from staying at hotel. There was no seafood. I would rather pay more and go to a better buffet that had seafood. After all that is why the buffets in Vegas are so great. They did have a good dessert selection. Cotton candy machine, ice cream and mini doughnuts.
1718	1	I had read that this was the best Thai food in North America. That is saying A LOT, so I went in trying not to have super high expectations because I knew I would probably just be disappointed.  I was sooo wrong. This place is AMAZING, and most definitely is, the BEST THAI FOOD IN NORTH AMERICA.  There is a caveat though. We went for dinner on Friday night, and that was the night it was the best Thai food ever. Went again on Monday for lunch, and it was only standard/good Thai food. I don't know if they have different cooks in the kitchen, or if we just ordered the wrong stuff on Monday, but it definitely wasn't as good.  Here are some dishes I'd highly suggest ordering:  -drunken shrimp with noodles underneath -- this was the dish my sister exclaimed she would talk about if she were on the show "Best Thing I Ever Ate" haha. enough said? -green curry -fried red snapper  -they had a veggie dish with fried pork belly. the fried pork belly was DELICIOUS. -fried banana with coconut ice cream and sticky rice -- THIS IS A MUST ORDER!!! Trust. -thai tea -- It inexplicably tastes fresher and higher quality that thai tea at other places...  This is going to be a regular stop on future Vegas trips for sure. I can't believe it took me this long to discover it! But I'm so glad I did! =)
828	1	Someone told us (my boyfriend and I) to find the Secret Pizza joint at the Cosmopolitan, and that we would LOVE it. And, after 30 minutes of searching for this place, we feel in LOVE with this place! (the alcohol might have helped)   I encourage everyone to adventure/trek/ search for this place. And when you find the place, order the White Pie Pizza - it's to die for!! Yummy yummy in my tummy. We also suggested this "pizza place" to our friend's parents who are of Sicilian decent, and they stated that the white pie pizza reminds them of their family made pizza from Sicily.
1684	0	I've lost my wonder for Serendipity. The first time I came here I was so excited and maybe that made the experience better, but to be honest this last time, it was MEH. I don't think Ill return again- it's one of those places where your like "okay been there done that, no need to try again". The portion are large but not that flavorful, kind of boring and expensive. Our table ordered breakfast and two frozen hot chocolates. The cookies and cream frozen hot chocolate is still the best, I strayed and ordered the Amaretto one, which was okay, but I felt like there was only a tiny bit of almond flavoring- so after the first few sips the flavor was gone. For breakfast we ordered the breakfast quesadilla and the breakfast sandwich- for the price I would rather of made these at home.   So I guess my point is go once, just to say you tried it, skip on the food and just get the frozen hot chocolate.
830	0	The name says it all. THIS should be your last resort.  We walked by this restaurant many times before deciding to go, it looked like a load of fun, the food was okay, not the greatest.   The biggest problem I had with this restaurant was the server, yes I know that you're supposed to get sarcastic service here and he was mouthy, which was great. But aside from being pretty much ignored most the time, even though he pretty much just wandered around most the time.   Near the end of our meal these two girls came in he sat there at the bar talking to them, he completely ignored us after that and he also had another large table of probably seven people, they had to bug him for their bill.   The second problem I had with this was the drinks, I bought the large margarita in the souvenir glass and yes I did order the extra shot, it came out so strong I couldn't drink it. My husband did but I did bring it up to the server that it was incredibly strong and bitter, not complaining mind you just to let them know and all he said was well he ordered the extra shot didn't you?  So all in all, this was not a very good meal save yourself some money and go else where. we wish we would have
159	1	This was a positively sublime burger-eating experience.  When in town for a weekend, this was the one place I wanted to make sure I stopped by, and I wasn't disappointed.  Buddy and I each ordered the kobe beef burger and couldn't have been happier.  The meat was prepared perfectly, and the list of available toppings was extensive.  I love that the toppings went from mild to wild and cheap to expensive.  This is probably the only place where one could get a burger with both shaved truffle slices and velveeta.  I went with carmelized onions and gorgonzola - delicious!  As others have said, you must try the sweet potato fries.  They are well worth the extra expense and are scrumptious.  One last piece of advice - do the call-ahead seating.  The restaurant doesn't do reservations, but you can call ahead up to a half hour.  My buddy and I did this and were able to walk right in upon arrival.  The place was packed, and the relatively huge line that formed behind us didn't care for us all that much.  In the end, the price was more than reasonable, given how well-prepared and customizable the meal is.  There may be a better burger somewhere else, but I certainly have yet to find it.
1282	0	We went to the Spice Market Buffet for dinner tonight around 9:00PM. I have to give only one star for this place mainly because of the demeanor of a cashier by the name of Mona who seemed to be ignoring us by not looking at us and moving to the back of the counter. She basically ignored us for about 5 minutes. When another couple came up behind us she quickly said "Can I help you". She should not be working in a position of greeting the public. She should be fired. I will follow this up with a letter to the management  The food at the buffet was not bad although expensive at $36 per person.
784	1	When we're in Vegas, we stay in the Venetian 90% of the time.  Having the restaurant right near our elevator is a plus, just a short walk and you'll get some great food.  My wife and I already enjoy The Cheesecake Factor, so with this being a sister company, I was sure we'd love it (and we did).  During our last visit a few months ago, where we stayed for 4 days, we at there at least once a day.  We ordered pizza, steak, italian, burgers and always had a very enjoyable meal.  The staff has always been helpful and friendly and we'll be going back again and again during each future visit!
1334	1	With over 2,000 reviews, I am not sure that there is much that I can add.  But I do want to make one suggestion to Yelpers:  Please, please, PLEASE look at the Northern Thai section of the menu.  While the rest of the menu is very, very good (especially loved the Garlic Prawns and Sea Bass on Drunken noodles), the Northern Thai section offers dishes that you won't find at most Thai restaurants.  We had two standouts, both based on recommendations of our very attentive waiter.  The first was Kang Ka Noon, which is jackfruit in a spicy curry sauce.  An article on NPR says that these are the largest tree fruit in the world, reaching up to 100 lbs each, and high in protein, potassium, and vitamin B2 (and yes, they are quite an interesting looking fruit).  However, when it is cut up and put into a dish, the jackfruit has the consistency of an artichoke heart.  Smooth, creamy and delicious.  And the curry sauce adds the perfect spice to balance the simple sweetness of the fruit.  The second dish was Khao Soi, a curried, egg noodle dish (with Burmese flavor influences) that we had with chicken.  Much like Pho has its salad accompaniment, so does Khao Soi:  onions, mustard greens, and lime.  Oh my goodness was this dish fantastic.  It was clearly the hit of the night.  So if you are an adventurous foodie (and you likely are if you are reading reviews in Yelp), step away from the traditional and go right for the Northern part of the menu.  You will not be sorry.
1803	1	We've been fans of Ramsay's tv shows and had always wanted to actually taste his food. We found ourselves in Vegas, staying at the Paris.  We finally had our chance to enjoy a Ramsay steakhouse and we were not disappointed.  The famous beef Wellington was not of this world. Amazing. Kobe A5 beef - melt in your mouth. Creamed corn, mushrooms, Mac and cheese, dear god it was all frigging awesome.  You don't get flavors like these cheaply and it was not cheap. But who cares?!  This was a wonderful experience and we can't wait to get back!
1092	0	DO NOT EVER EVER EVER CONSIDER STAYING HERE! it's cheap but it needs to be closed down. One thing is saving money another is putting up with the worst when your trying to enjoy Vegas. I know you think I'll barely be in the room try taking a shower in s tub that's clogged & the water not being able to be adjusted things broken dirty smelly. Elevators hVd tagging no a/c in the hallways it's a DISASTER!! Circus circus is probably better then this and that's a Hot mess itself ! SHOP AROUND BALLYS FLAMINGO ETC .....
41	0	Do not come here.. Horrible service.. bland food.. waste of time.. Go to Earl Sandwiches instead.    Came here Fri after a night out.. Sat early AM.. and ordered the congee and the duck soup... YUCK.. Worst $23 spent ever and horrible service! Why did it take 30 minutes to get our food? 2 items? No cooking needed, just scooping the soup up... the congee was so bland.. drinking water was better that that.. and the duck soup..The noodles weren't even cooked all the way!  It was still all stuck together.. Waste of time and money.. and it was so hard to track down our server, let alone trying to pay our bill... Wish we just walked out..
1838	1	It is not a secret anymore!!! So sad!! This place is open until 5am, and that is a beautiful thing! The pizza is reasonably priced considering that it's Las Vegas, and it's a NY size slice. It is PERFECT for a late night snack after Marquee.  Go find it! Good luck! There is no signage!
1522	1	In Vegas, every restaurant claims some sort of award. Holsteins is one of them, and deservedly so. Banana Foster milkshake was super good. Steakhouse Burger was perfectly done and absolutely delicious. Sweet potato fries also crispy and sweet, fabulous onion rings. Decor is awesome with hilarious pictures of their cow logo. Jordan was our server and she helpful and friendly (and cute). High recommendation in a city with many overpriced sub-par burgers.
1972	0	First time at restaurant and got a deal for dinner on Groupon for $65.00. I made reservations for 7:15. We got to the restaurant at 7:05 checked in with the front and they told me it would be about 10 minutes. No problem we went and walked out in front entrance for there was no seating inside but stood by the entrance. We had been waiting for about 15 minutes and walked back to check if they had our table. The front desk asked me for my name again and said have a seat. About another 15 min go by and they finally called our name and the host had told me they called my name already and another guest had taken our reservation and was seated. No big deal it happens. We waited almost 10 minutes for a server to come to our table. He just took our drink order and walked away. We sat there not knowing what to do here and how it worked. He finally came back after a long time had passed with our drinks and explained what we were to do. Salad bar was very delicious but I was not too happy about the meat carvers. We only had 4 to 5 different carvers to table and 2 was the same meat. We has one serving of shrimp/salmon and one serving of pineapple. We were there for an hour and a half from time of checking in and eating. I would never pay full price for this place for customer service is terrible. The salmon was absolutely terrible. I would never recommend this place to anyone.
1461	0	I've stayed at Caesar's Palace several times and always order to go from Noodle No.9. When ordering to go, the service is always professional, the food excellent. This time i decided to dine-in. My only explanation for the lack of good service would be that it must be a cultural one. The staff is pretty professional - but i never saw one smile. And when i would ask for a substitution, it was met with much resistance. Then, when ordering desert, i was in a hurry and wanted my ice cream to go, they said they wouldn't - i was like "put it in a dixie cup!" But i do have to say - the atmosphere is amazing and the food is great - i just think the entire staff needs to go through an american customer service training - ASAP!
46	1	Admittedly, I would have given this place four stars due to the sheer exorbitant prices if it weren't for the amazing, if not the best, burgers I have had in my 26 years of life. And believe me, I've had my fair share of burgers. Okay - enough about the rave and onto the food:  I must start with the free starter popcorn, which was perfectly salted and just the right amount of butter so good that I had to ask for second!  For appetizer, we ordered the Surf and Turf Quesadillas, which has a combination of broiled steak and lobster that complements surprisingly well topped off with Manchego cheese to give it a rich texture to go along with Avocado cream that leaves a rather refreshing after taste  For main course, I ordered the Rising Sun burger (A must have based on other yelpers' validations) and the steak fries as a side. The juicy Kobe beef spread with the Teriyaki glaze just burst with flavor, but not too salty as it is matched with a slightly sweet addition from the cripsy yam. At the same time, the Spicy mayo and tempura avocada adds a tantalizing kick to the already delicious burger all on its own. I also added a fried Egg which just kicks it up another notch. The steak fries that came with the burger just left me speechless as I could not even taste the grease but had so much crisp and flavor that left me licking the seasoning off of my thumbs   All in all, what more can you ask for than a perfect burger and a beer in a chilling afternoon at Vegas? I would have liked to try Truffle lobster Mac N Cheese but there just was not enough stomach to fit it all or time on the agenda to come back for round 2. Definitely a 5 star unforgettable experience - Super winning!
745	1	Best steak of my life! I'm not kidding! This place is fantastic- I don't even know where to begin. I didn't think the greens beans would be one of the most memorable parts of my dish. I think it caught me off guard how amazing green beans could taste. The steak is out of this world- it cuts like butter. And there isn't a better way to end your meal than with sticky toffee pudding!
1321	0	Just left Rustler's Roost, chose it for my birthday dinner I should have just gone to Texas Road House! The food is better, cheaper and the service is 100% better. The view was nice but not worth the time we spent driving there. We had a young snotty waitress that completely ruined the experience for me and the food was subpar! Much better choices out there for sure. Put a damper in my birthday but over it and looking forward to the rest of my night.
422	0	When reminiscing upon my experience at Beijing Noodle No. 9, one of my standard catchphrases comes to mind - UGH.  My friends had chosen it based on convenience, since we were staying in the hotel and were already in need of a nap.  My foodie alarm definitely sounded at this appalling selection.   The service here was very straightforward and certainly not accompanied by a smile.  The food was pretty terrible as well, with most items doused in salt.  The Sweet Red Bean Buns were perfectly moist and stuffed with the dessert-like paste.  This was the sole highlight of the meal.  The Hand-Pulled Noodles were mediocre at best and rather mushy, in actuality.  The Diced Eggplant Sauce that covered the noodles was so salty that no amount of water managed to rehydrate us.  The Seafood and Egg White Fried Rice was unmemorable and similarly salty.  The main feature that this dining establishment has going for it is the futuristic, white decor that makes you feel as if you are in a spaceship.  The beautiful fish tank also enhances the atmosphere.  However, with so many great restaurants in town, Beijing Noodle No. 9 is not worth your time...or even this rhyme!
1762	1	I'm not sure what people expect from a fast-ish food joint.  Your review should be for what it is, not on what you're comparing it to.  GEEZ!!!  Awesome burger.  It may actually become my go-to fast food burger when in Vegas.  Sorry In-&-Out...  This is a really good burger that actually seems more like a back-yard barbecue style than the traditional frozen patty that you seem to get everywhere else.  Good fries, good drinks and good vibes.  Go to Shake Shack if you want to keep your taste "buds" buds.
1898	0	What is there to add?   ROOMS  PLUS-Room in the Monaco Tower was clean, the bed comfortable, the water pressure fantastic, and a tub that drained quickly.   MINUS-My brother booked the conference rate....big mistake   CONFERENCE CENTER  PLUS-Lots of rooms and adaptable to the needs of our workshop   MINUS-Time warp to the '80s   CASINO  PLUS-The lights were on and the machines worked   MINUS-Dowdy, rundown, and stank of encrusted smoke   FOOD/OTHER SERVICES  PLUS-None (the lights were on)   Minus-Only went to the buffet for dinner. Better bet: exit the hotel and go to the Peppermill next door.   I'm not quite sure how the Riviera survives in the cut-throat environment of the Strip. They must get enough bus tours and conferences to keep the dollars flowing. It is convenient to Circus Circus and a short walk to the Wynn. If you are looking for an experience of the Strip today, keeping walking. If you want a cheap room in a run down hotel, the Riviera is the place for you.
459	0	Thought this might be fun to try on a our trip to Vegas but I would definitely give this a miss. We ordered a lot of the dumplings (not great, and I know dumplings!), plus some noodle dishes, a soup (bland broth) and the Mongolian lettuce salad (the vinegar was overpowering and the sauce gluggy, as if it was out of a bottle).  We then had some tacos and these were much better (especially the carnitas and duck tongue). The Cosmopolitan seems to be full of hen's weekends so the restaurant was full of big bridal shower groups, not our scene.
1432	1	Womp..... OF COURSE THIS PLACE GETS 5 STARS.  Trust me, I wanted to break the best-pizza-ever-i-promise streak!!!! But... its THE BEST PIZZA EVER, I PROMISE! I lived in the New Jersey/New York area for quite some time so I've tried pizzas from Hoboken to Brooklyn. Let me tell you, this pizza can DEFINITELY compare. I swear there's something in their water. Their crust made me jizz my pants.   If there's a line.. just WAIT. Please experience this ride for yourself.  Takes your pizza dreams where they've never gone before.   Also, they offer hipster beers (pbr, etc) for cheaps!  Can't wait for another marquee/secret pizza night in VLV.
1627	0	Free wine and beer now for the price to get in.....but don't expect anything that tastes good....I had the red wine....sad Cab.  I wanted to go back as I remember this being a good buffet.  I went to the buffet and the ARIA the day before.  Don't kid yourself the ARIA is WAY better than this.  This is a very average Vegas buffet.  To give you a little perspective....at the Mirage they have 1 Vanilla Gelato and 1 Chocolate Gelato.  Then 3 Sorbets....At the ARIA they have over 12 Gelato's of great quality.  Even simple things like macaroons are way better at the ARIA.  If you can afford to pay the $8 more run to the ARIA.  You will be able to fill up here but it will all be very average food.
1261	1	i am a fan! too bad this place is in vegas.. very pricey but understandable.. they have a fried portabello mushroom inside the shack stack so you can see why they charge what they charge.. it's not just patty cheese veggies n bread.. they fancy.. you cannot compare this to in and out because they are different.. you can compare this to five guys and they totally kill em.. the shakes are weird though b/c it's just like in n  out.. not cold enough.. we also had the cheese fries.. YUM YUM! cant wait to get my hands on this place again
1785	0	Vary Poor customer Service from the front door to the Bartenders. The Worst of them Was the So Called Manager. they really all should take Customer Service 101 Training I Would Definitely Not Recommend Any One to Go There. Manager Should go Have His 200.00 Walmart Suit Pressed Out.
1316	1	This is one of my best meals in Vegas! I have never experienced real Thai food until now. Normally I would have settled for the usual pad thai and pad see ew. However, I wanted to be adventurous this time. I tried the nam kao tod as an appetizer, and it was AMAZING - the crispy rice with the pork sausages, lime juice, chili, and green onions make my mouth water. Hands down, the best Thai dish ever!!! I even looked up recipes online to try to replicate this dish at home.   We also tried the garlic prawns that were deep fried; the dish was deliciously crunchy. Our third dish was the crispy duck in Khao Soi (thai egg noodles in a curry sauce). The crispy duck was yummy, but got a little soggy in the Khao Soi. It would have been slightly better if the crispy duck was separated from the Khao Soi, and combined the two later to maintain the crispness in the duck.   The menu is quite extensive. My boyfriend and I were quite overwhelmed. We could only fit in three dishes between the two of us. I would highly recommend this place. You'd be really missing out if you don't give it a shot!   Service was friendly and fast.   There is plenty of parking in the plaza.
1324	1	I live in LA, so I go to Vegas pretty often, and since I'm also a Yelp fiend, Lotus of Siam had been on my list for many years. Since I rarely wander off the Strip, I managed to miss it on every trip until a couple months back, when I made the trip with a few friends.  We booked well in advance, but were able to change a table for 3 to a table for 5 the day of our dinner. Our reservation was for 8:30 on a Monday, so probably not a peak time, though the place was very busy the whole time we were there. (You can also walk in, apparently, but it sounds like the waits get long.) The restaurant was in a huge strip mall, with the kind of parking lot ideal for teaching teens to drive, or testing specially modified DeLoreans. The space itself was comfortable--not small for a family-run Thai restaurant in the desert, but not big for what could be Vegas's most hyped off-Strip attraction.  I liked the atmosphere, which was homey but upbeat, with tons of accolades and celebrity photos on the wall (though the only person I recognized was Asian fiend Nick Cage). Ah, the bald boastfulness of accomplished immigrants--I know it well. Service was good, fast and attentive, even as a crowd of dishes created near chaos on our table.  The food was excellent, every bite loaded to bursting with flavor. We ordered a family style feast, and everything was delicious and satisfying in that way that makes you wonder, why eat at fancy restaurants when Thai food is just better? Lotus of Siam outshines most restaurants on the Strip, and its price point is a lot more friendly.  The moo yang was irresistible, a plate of marinated charbroiled pork, tenderly chewy with a caramelized char, served with a homemade spicy dipping sauce. The papaya salad was classic--green papaya, chili, tomato, crushed peanuts, lime juice, fish sauce, sugar--and nicely executed, made with a ton of heat. One of Lotus of Siam's signature dishes, which I'd never had anywhere else, was the garlic prawn. I can see why people talk come here for this--it was utterly addictive, deep fried prawns sauted in a house garlic sauce and topped with ground black pepper. Tons of flavor, and a flaky, chip-like texture. I don't tend to love prawn shells, but these were put to beautiful use.  The bulk of our meal came in the form of curries and carbs. The khao soi was another house specialty--crispy duck on egg noodles in a curry-based sauce, garnished with scallions, lime, and pickled vegetables. This was spectacular, somewhere between a noodle soup and a curry, with a thick, complex sauce that was thin enough to eat by the spoonful. I also loved the kang hung lay, a spicy stewy Northern pork curry. The portion was small, but the contents were rich, the pork cooked so tender it was falling apart in the curry. On the more everyday Thai side of things, I really enjoyed the panang curry with chicken, and the pineapple fried rice was solid.  The check came before we could order dessert--it's possible our server thought we'd had quite enough, which wasn't inaccurate. There's always next time--now that I've been to Lotus of Siam, I'll drag people off the Strip to go back.
1819	1	And here I am thinking that this place was a hidden gem. 82 reviews before me? I'm instantly flaccid. This is like finding out your favorite band is opening for Nickelback.  Ronin burger. Parmesan truffle fries. Lychee soda. Like --- total stomach erection.  Best part is that it's open late... it's going to give Naked Fish a run for its money as a late night poker hangout!
1821	1	If you're in Vegas and you're looking for KBBQ, you ABSOLUTELY MUST come eat here! This is the best KBBQ I've ever eaten. Literally everything was really, really good.   We ordered the Gangnam to split between 4, and subbed the miso soup for the kimchi chigae for no extra charge. It was enough food to provide us another meal. I really appreciated that the meats were fresh, had their own flavor, and were not overly salty. Food highlights/must haves: kimchi and bibimbap.   Staff here are super nice and accommodating!
1345	1	It can't be a trip to Vegas without grabbing a slice of pizza from the secret pizza place in the Cosmo hotel. Every slice is delicious down to the last bite. There's mainly standing room to eat your pizza but right outside there's plenty of seating in the hotel. You can see them making the pizza right as you walk in! It's a good place for a quick bite, they usually have a couple of different pizzas made where you can order by the slice, but don't fret, they also make whole pizzas for takeout.
876	1	On a bachelorette party trip to Vegas, I think we ate every meal at Bouchon!  Must haves include:  Sourdough waffles-  Umm, why don't we have these in San Francisco?  I don't even like waffles. The vanilla bean butter made these feel like dessert.  French toast- dessert for breakfast.  Croque Madame- Amazing grilled cheese (it better be at $19). So good it is on the brunch and dinner menu.  Kir Royal- The best adult beverage of your life, blackcurrant champagne fizz  Warning: The coffee may cause you to found a new religion or branch of philosophy.  No matter how hung over, you will not be hanging out by the pool after a cup of this Joe!  For dinner,  Salude de Poulpe- I have a soft (not rubbery) spot for octopus.   Followed by Truite aux Almandes- picture almonds, lots of almonds, over a bed of  green beans and butter.    No dessert this time.    To make the weekend last for the rest of the week, I brought home Macaroons in neon colors.  Each one was  essence of pistachio, coffee, strawberry, lemon, vanilla or chocolate that melts in your mouth.  Perfect with my morning coffee.    Can't wait to go back.
1719	1	Amazing food, very flavorful, and incredibly helpful service who advised against some items we were getting that had a similar sauce and then recomended something else that was amazing. And the price is so reasonable! Definitely worth the cab ride off of the stip.
1273	0	So watching them make the noodles is very cool. And makes you want to try it.     So we were there at 9pm and it was not busy but for some reason we and other people waited for 20 min.  Probably was understaffed but I counted 5 servers serving on 7 tables. Probably could do more but hey I don't run it.   Beef noodle soup was the highlight they were great. Wish the fresh made noodle Had tapioca in it to make chewier.    The Dan Dan.   Sucked.  I mean take noodles had spicey sesame oil and there you go.   Oh wait forgot there was a tiny bit of meat.    Other dishes we got were not memorable so   Would go back for beef noodle assuming I won at the tables. Haahaa
157	0	Our group ate a predetermined BBQ meal consisting of chicken, beef rib, beans, corn on the cob, salad, and a roll. Paula Deen would be proud. Much of the food I had in AZ was piss poor. I was hoping to order off the menu which I assume has got to be better. The view isn't all that great either. What is there to look at? The buildings downtown waaaay off in the distance?  The urinals(2) in the men's room are placed right next to each other almost like it's designed for siamese twins to pee in. There is no divider. What a joy to have some idiot step up and piss that close to me. I could only picture there being splatter all over my jacket & pants. Ugh, what an ordeal.
847	1	Love love loved it!!!!  When I found out we were going to Vegas I KNEW this was the first place I'd hit up... Yes we are DDD groupies and we were not deceived!!!!!!!  We arrived around 1pm on a Thursday - there wasn't a wait!!!!!  Our server was so hospitable - he was polite, attentive, and really seemed to enjoy his job... his cheerfulness actually made me a little happier... He gave us recommendations (even though Guy Fieri already showed me (Kalbi) what I was getting, my BF took the server up on his recommendation (Miyagi San) and wasn't disappointed)!  Like the true fat asses we are, we started with the oxtail chili cheese fries with extra chili aioli on the side - SOOOOO GOOD... The runny egg yolk dispersing over the tender meat, jalapeos, and crispy fries... #heaven! Our burgers were cooked perfectly - medium well, as requested! I love all Asian food - Asian anything makes me happpppppy... so my Kalbi marinated burger with kimchi, HIT THE SPOT... I could eat it weekly and not get sick of it!!!  We finished off with the Portuguese donuts - I wasn't impressed... Mainly Bcuz the donuts were raw on the inside... but I was too stuffed to complain.  Overall this was a great experience (sans donuts)...
1923	0	Casino review only: Ya this is an old casino but I was in there a couple of days ago and they seem to have refurbished it some.  It was a good place to gamble and the staff was all friendly & helpful.  Food court was pretty good, great pizza, and pinball hall of fame annex is a nice distraction.  I liked the Riv for both it's history and the effort they're making to make it nicer.  Sadly in late 2012 & 13 my visits weren't so nice.  Drink service is non existent in casino and bars are understaffed with surly bartenders.  Riv is typical of a dying property and it's a shame, so much history here :-(
435	1	MAN did I love this place! I really love how creative they are with their presentation. The Fried Chicken Benedict was almost doing too much, but it was worth it! The corned beef hash was great. I have no complaints at all about that. The blueberry pecan flapjack was amazing. We were all talking about the pecans. Then later on that night I snuck away to try one of the scrambles. Another hit!! Everything was amazing!
501	1	Gem's Secret!  For my 20th review, I'm going to share with you a golden gem secret...The best place to eat in The Cosmopolitan won't cost you all of your night's winnings, and you won't be ready to go buffet again right away! But it's whereabouts are incognito, so I will yelp you out & share the secret! After a long night of committing sins in Sin City, you must find & dine at the clandestine "Secret Pizza."  Secret Pizza is a hidden gem located in The Cosmopolitan Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, NV.It's a tiny, gemazing pizza joint located on the 3rd floor of The Cosmo next to the Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill. You will see an unmarked hallway that's lined with cool, vintage record album covers that is across from the pool table located in the middle of the room, go down it & enter secret pizza paradise!  Secret Pizza sells a variety ofbomb, thin/foldable, NY-style pizzas sold by the slice that are pre-made & they warm up for you in the oven. The price for 1 slice is around $5-6, more if you get a specialty slice or add extra toppings. (Secret Pizza also has a "deep-dish looking" pizza slice option, but I didn't try it. This isn't Chicago, stick with the original, thin slices!) You can also order & carry-out a whole pie or customize a cheese slice like I did. My fave was cheese with mushrooms, green peppers & banana peppers, 5 gems!!  When I stayed at The Cosmo, I ended every night/began each morning at Secret Pizza or ate there after an expensive app at Milos! The pizzas are cut into big, triangular slices & have the perfect ratio of thinness while still having some girth; softness for folding with a nice, crispy crust; and contains the perfect amount of grease to equalize the night's BAC! Definitely not the kind of 'Za I typically consume but what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas!  FYI: Secret Pizza also has a free, self-serve/purified water tank, sells beer & has limited seating, only countertops & some barstools, no tables. However, you can sit & eat at the couches by the pool table I mentioned above.   So if you're stayin' or playin' in The Cosmo, win,lose or draw, you will definitely wanna make Secret Pizza your last call! Cuz one thing is for sure, you can bet your ass, ya will friggin' eat it all!

I will never visit this place again!!!!  1- You are on the complete opposite side of the strip 2- they are still charging a crazy amount per night 3- The rooms are old, and make me want to sleep in my car.  The hotel is very old. I did not have the best experience there. I had to call room servicer to have them change my sheets. They were not clean. I dont recomend this place at all.  But on a bright side i will give the buffett a 5 stars. I keep telling myself tht if i go back to Vegas i will visti their buffett. You pay I believe $15 or $16 per person all you can eat. But they have a pasta buffett where they will cook you chicken, shrimp, with any kind of pasta i personally loved it this must of been the best thing about the entire trip. The buffett highly recomended. To stay, defenitley find else where.

The tanginess and these crunch lil things which I suspect is fried roe makes the dish! The tacos were blah and bland and most dissapointing of all was some wheat noodles with tiger sauce. We thought the sauce sounded exciting and exotic but it was just chinese fermented bean sauce. This sauce does nothing to boost the flavor of the horribly bland wheat noodles. Totally disappointing and I will not be back!.
842	0	Just returned from a Vegas weekend and this restaurant and service was just terrible. The layout of the restaurant should have been better to accommodate size and demands of tourists and visitors instead of only being able to service the basic size of a mom & pop shop. It has a great area for outdoor seating but the shade and covering or cooling was not enough for Nevada 104+ F demands. The host and service was NOT great at all and good luck trying to find a seat and service with a party greater than 3. We were forced to wait an hour and a half in 104 F when we just had to give up because although we confronted the host as to why several parties were being let in (parties of 1 & 2), our party of 5 is just too big for them and it's easier to let people with smaller parties in. So very rude and not worth the wait.  My highest recommendations to you, if you're willing to pay the same amount for Serendipity 3 go inside Caesars with A/C and comfy seating and shade. Find a bakery called Payard's Patisserie and get their drinks and pastries, just the same price (perhaps portions are smaller regarding pastries but they are in French style-size, drinks are huge) and BONUS they give free samples.  Will fly to NYC for the original shop and avoid this mock.
680	1	I grew up in Montana. I know a good burger when I sink my teeth into it. Imagine my surprise when the best burger I've ever had the opportunity to experience (at a restaurant,) came from Vegas.  The kobe beef burger is worth every penny. The service is great, Sin City beer is good. There can be a bit of a wait, depending on when you get there, but it's worth it.  Doesn't quite compare to the fresh burgers my dad used to make, but it comes damn close.  If you love burgers, you have to check out the Burger Bar.
941	1	Modern Korean bbq with a great selection of meats and appetizers. It's a mix between Korean and Japanese and the quality of the meat is much better than all you can eat. I recommend both the marinated and non marinated Kalbi for beef. Spicy garlic and calamari and spicy pork are also great. Close to the strip is well and much better than anything close by.
1834	0	We went here to order breakfast at around 6am on a Sunday morning. Unfortunately we didn't even get that far. The waitress who was assigned to our table refused to take our orders because a "new shift" was starting even though we had been waiting for 20 minutes. We talked to the hostess and all she did was tell us which waitress was assigned to our table, the one who still refused to take our order. Given this terrible service we left. Needless to say, we won't be coming back.
768	1	We heard that breakfast here was a chance to eat a fairly affordable meal ($15-$22) at a Thomas Keller restaurant.  We came here on a weekday morning just after 9am and were seated promptly with a smile, a few rows away from the small pool outside (the hostess joked that it was the Venetian's "kiddie pool").  The restaurant is smaller than I thought it would be, with very high ceilings and an airy, sunlit atmosphere.    I had the Breakfast Jardiniere with eggs over medium, choosing a chocolate croissant.  It was obvious that the chefs really pay attention to the details.  The croissant came first with a cup of fruit.  Flaky and amazingly buttery, the croissant had delicious bittersweet chunks of chocolate.  Each cube of fruit, whether grape or cantaloupe, was sweet and ripe.   The eggs came with a toasted brioche, sauteed spinach, and a side of potatoes cut to the size of nickels.  The eggs were an incredibly deep yellow color (from naturally-raised chickens, perhaps?) that I haven't seen from eggs in ages.  The light oil and salt on the potatoes made for a tiny dance of flavor in my mouth.  The sauteed spinach came with big chunks of garlic.  I'm a real garlic lover, so I actually wanted an even stronger garlic taste from the spinach, but I couldn't complain about the tender texture.  I also tried the Oeuf Au Gratin, a deep dish of baked eggs that was a spoonful of richness.  Their coffee was excellent, and their orange juice was very good as well.  I'm recommending this breakfast to all my friends that are headed to Vegas.  Breakfast service ends at 10:30am I believe, which might be difficult for the night-owl party types in Sin City.
1192	0	Cost is ~ $40 for dinner.  The Chinese food wasn't very tasty and the carvery had very dry meat.  That's okay because they have a large selection.  They also had crag legs, both warm and cold, but the thing that grossed me out was when I saw one of the workers putting the cold seafood away with his bare hands!  At first, I thought he must be throwing them away, but after walking around to see where he was placing the crab legs in, I was shocked to see that he was putting them away and not throwing them away.  Now that may have happened just that one night, right?  Wrong!  I had to go back a couple days later because a few of my colleagues wanted a buffet and it happened to be one of the few w/in walking distance and was opened.  I thought...maybe that was just that one time....  Nope, I saw the same guy cleaning up with his bare hands..  If you want to get ripped off and have some "natural" crab leg tastes, then go here!
111	0	Not impressed. Evening dinner before a show on 1 Oct 16.  Very poor start with reservations running behind.  When we were seated 10 minutes behind our time there were plenty of seats available. Some tables had things others did not even the basics like salt and pepper.  I looked over the salad bar while waiting on the server and it was not worth the effort. We ordered the drinks and the meal immediately since we had the time to read the menu ahead and the drinks showed up 5 minutes behind the meal. (15 minutes). the meal was prepared well but the serving size to cost was poor (almost twice what I would pay elsewhere for a filet mignon). Our server was slow on checking on drink refills and even slower handling the check. They were using a tablet system to order (supposedly for the first night) and finalize the checks but watching him the receipt printers were a challenge.  The restaurant itself looked satisfactory as far as decor but the bathroom was undersized for a restaurant of that style where people are going to stay and eat a while for their money.  I am certain we could find a better place on the strip.
1081	1	Taking into account location, comparable places nearby, pricing, and of course the quality of food, it is impossible to rate this place any lower than 5 stars. Really cool place that makes you feel as if you've stepped out of the Cosmopolitan and into any hole-in-the-wall pizza across America. The pizza was great, but the real winner for us was the cheesecake. $4.50 for a giant piece that easily feeds two hungry people. There was no line when we went (around noon on New Years Eve). The ONLY complaint was there being nowhere to sit, but even that isn't a big deal since there is seating everywhere in the Cosmo.
666	0	My friend and I spent all weekend excited about going to the famous Serendipity before we left Vegas. We waited close to an hour and sat on on a table that had been open the entire time we were waiting and asked them 30 minutes before if we could just sit on that table. The staff were very unfriendly and slow and the food was not worth the wait. I hope the one in NY lives up to the name because Vegas does not.
244	0	The food here is horrible.  Me and my hubby came here for lunch last Saturday before I went to go shoot a wedding over at the Flamingo (which is another damn story).  The price tag was off for the food they had to offer, but there wasn't a line around 1:45, it was almost $60 for the both of us.  They didn't even have any shell fish at this price.  I hadn't been to the MGM since I was a kid and wanted to just go and see it again and try the food, which proved to be horrific.  Going up and down the aisles, I realized that a lot of the food was really repetitive, they had your fried/southern comfort food, your "asian" food, including teriyaki fish, noodles, sushi, etc.  They had their breakfast items, salads, veggies, fruits, desserts.  I'm pregnant, which totally multiplies my love for food by like umpteenth times, but before being pregnant I could take down a whole cow if you gave me a few hours, but this place couldn't even make pancakes that were appetizing enough.  I had these scalloped potatoes with cheese and sour cream, I believe, on it, and the potatoes weren't even fully cooked.  Phil had some fried chicken and fish items, which were not good.  I also had the teriyaki fish I mentioned earlier and the minute I put it in my mouth I had this overwhelming taste of ginger.  I had the couscous salad which tasted much like toothpaste.  Honestly, I can say that the only thing good about this place was the veggies, oh and the nachos, but how could you fuck up tortilla chips and cheese, but everything else was horrible.  They put such a bad taste in my mouth that I didn't even bother getting desserts and I have the worst sweet tooth, and if anything I'm sure the desserts would've put me in a better mood.  In the end, we left unsatisfied, a trip to Carl's Jr. probably would've done a better job at feeding me and my husband.
1422	0	My boyfriend and I had bought tickets at one of those half off ticket places and we asked where we should eat before the show, they recommended this place. The menu looked pretty good when we got there, so my hopes were high. We had potstickers as an appetizer (they tasted as though they had been in a freezer for way too long and they had been microwaved).... My Kobe beef hamburger which I order medium was completely burnt. All I could taste was burnt. Then my boyfriend, who ordered his steak medium rare said he didn't even think they cooked it. His asparagus was cold too. Only thing decent about this place was the French fries. And to top if off, our order took FOREVER! I think they forgot about us. The waitress even commented that it was taking sooooo long and said she would talk to her manager about comping half of our meal. The manager came out, and apologized...then they said they would give us a free dessert too because it took so long. We end up never getting dessert and they comped NOTHING for us. So basically, my recommendation would be never ever go here. The end.
905	1	Be prepared to wait, or make a reservation! We had a great experience. We did not make a reservation, so had a drink at the bar while we waited.   Atmosphere was typical of an old school Asian restaurant. There seemed to be no dresscode, as people were both very casual and somewhat formal.   Food was amazing - fresh and flavourful. Service was friendly and relatively quick. Would definitely recommend.
153	0	Unfortunately, this bar has false advertisement provided by desperate promoters outside the bar. First off they give you a bracelet and make you believe that the entrance is free, when it really wasn't.  Second,  the promoter told us that the bar closes at 4 am, we got there about 2 am and they ended kicking everybody out at 315. FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!  I'll never go back.
1863	0	We ordered the deep fried oreo sundae. It took a long time to get it. When they finally brought it out, they took it to the wrong table. When we got it, it was melted and the oreos were soggy. My kids tried to eat it, but it just wasn't good. After quite a while, I finally got the waiter to come over. I told him it wasn't good, and that we didn't want it. He took it away, and the manager came over a few minutes later. She wanted to know what the problem was, so I explained that it took too long to come out and when it did, it was goopy and not good. She tried to give excuses and reasons why it sometimes tastes like that. After I told her I just didn't want it, she said she would "take care of it". When we got the bill, she still charged us $9 for it. Full price was $15, so we had to pay for more than half of something that we didn't enjoy and didn't eat. That's the last time we go there. There's just too many choices in Vegas to need to go there again.
588	1	I usually don't like to eat on The Strip when I'm in Vegas, but I was tempted to check out this place. I loved the cow art all over the restaurant. Our waiter was very attentive and the service was amazing. Yes, these buglers are not cheep, and your bill will probably go up if you're drinking, but then again it's The Strip.  I had the Gold Standard, which was one of the best burgers ever. The meat was delicious and the goat cheese complimented the burger perfectly. My friend had the burger with pork rinds and oaxacan cheese, which was so good. It was my heavy at all it was actually perfect. I really wanna try their adult shakes next time I'm there. Great beer selection also. They know their beers and burgers which is an A+ for me.
1735	0	I was going to give it one star, but since its a clean, nice looking place, i gave it an additional star.   i was happy and excited to have lee's sandwich finally in vegas. when i was in long beach ca, i use to drive 30-40mins just to have a sandwich at lee's. But lee's here in vegas, i wont even drive 5-10mins to get there.  Its just not lee's. The sandwich just dont have any taste. And like some of the comments before mine, hardly any meat in the sandwiches.  i guess im sticking with the grilled pork at PHO THANH HUONG. The best banh mi sandwiches i had so far in vegas. And its 3 dollars only.   Edit: PHO THANH HUONG  has changed owner/management and i am not a fan of the food anymore.
8	1	The food was great!   Our waitress was very occupied though, because I had to ask another waitress twice to get her.  We ordered the buffalo chicken rolls and they were delicious!  Crisp, hot and very good flavor. Then I got the pasta and salad lunch portion.  My pasta was very good. I ordered the Carbonara. A little too much peas for me, but after I picked a few off the top, it was good.  The salad was a small portion of greens on the side, but was perfect since the appetizer filled me up.  I also ordered a Blanco Sangria and it was just a 3 out of 5.  Drinkable, but wouldn't order again.   I really enjoyed the food, so I am still giving this a 5 regardless of the drink and service.  I will return.
999	0	Let me get to the point right now... DO NOT EAT HERE!  This was a BOMB from start to finish and a complete waste of $157.00 for 4 people.  We made reservations.  When we showed up the hostess tried to put us outside where everyone walks by you. We noticed that's whereshe tries to put everyone initially. It's obviously is an effort to gain attention of by-passers, who think "wow, let's eat here, it's so busy".   It's very impersonal area, so we said we will sit inside.  So now she makes us wait for like 7+ minutes.  The inside was nearly empty and we still waited.  The waitress looked "frazzled" that we choise to eat inside.  So she seats us next to an entry way like a thoroughfare, but this place is nearly empty.  Many nice tables available.  Then we waited nearly 10 minutes for someone to say "hi" I'm your waiter/waitress.  We were just ready to leave this place when out of the blue, a waitress greets us with a really bad vibe, unhappy feeling, impersonable to say the least.  So I order the unlimited meat thing for $37.95 or close to that price.  Well to keep this short, the meat carving people DO NOT make their rounds consistently.  They leave you waiting for more than 10-15 minutes at a time before another meat arrives.  I sat there looking around thinking what the heck is going on here?  Then someone shows up.  You can feel the reluctancy to carve you any decent sized portion.  Then you wait 10-15 minutes... another person comes, you get the picture???  One of my guests had a halibut fish at $27.99.  It was sadly the size of a king-sized pack of cigarettes, with some steamed veggies and that was a bit dry.  This was a let down.  My wife's dish was a lobster bouilliabaise.  The dish was mediocre, the tiny shrimp you had to find in the soup, the mussels were so tiny that I cant believe they would serve that!  The pasta was overcooked.  They only served me 5  types of meat while there. The filet mignon was the only one I could comfortably chew.  The rest of the meat was not very tender and tasty.  We over-heard our waitress complaining to another one saying the meat service is affecting her tips.   Yes it does, and so does her crappy personality.  Let me tell all of you that read this.  This place survives, thanks to the countless tourist turn-over.  This place is so desperate, they hand-out discount coupons in front of their place to the people that walk by....if you walk in because you wanted to anyhow, no discount coupon offer for you!   Plus take in mind my earlier comment about how thay want you to sit out front so they can market you to other suckers walking by. This place is no better than an average dinner buffet for $12.95.  I should have payed attention to the other Yelper comments out there, and I got burned.  Oh yeah, our seats were badly covered in grease drippings and other spills left behind from customers.  Gross!  One last thing, when we left, we walked by a hostess or a waitress who was using a company computer moniter station area  to check her FaceBook photos.... "class act" here people.  You can see, this place is a BOMB from start to finish.  Take my advice.... and others.... just pass over this place, it should close it's doors... for good.
1039	0	I want to give more stars because the Chinese food is surprisingly good and authentic. Noodles are a must try! But the service is just SO damn bad. It was an hour wait (but I saw so many empty tables). Good thing I could go waste some time and money in the casino while waiting.   The hostesses at the front were rude and incompetent. The specific server I had was slow and rude as well. We ordered tomato egg noodles, scallion pancakes, and dumplings. We got the first two dishes and finished those and sat waiting around for the dumplings. FINALLY she came to us and told us the dumplings came apart while cooking. Okay...???????? Like wtf LOL and she expected us to just cancel the order. But we said we still wanted it, and she seemed annoyed.  Very pricey.
490	0	Welcome to the Old Country Buffet of the Aria. For the Aria being a five star resort, it is shocking the buffet is expensive (around $50 a person with tax) for the poor quality. Aria has many great options, sadly the Buffet at Aria is no longer one. The food is mass produced and has little attention to detail. Desserts taste as if they might be the day over left overs from the higher quality options onsite. If you are looking for a much better option- walk across the street to the Cosmo with Wicked Spoon. Aria could learn a lot from their buffet.
662	0	This was my third time staying at the LVH. With my company,I travel to numerous trade shows, many of which are held in Las Vegas. This hotel is very dated but always seemed to be the best option for location and proximity to the convention center. Well, this particular trip turned ugly when on the second morning of my stay I woke up, went to the restroom and when I returned to bed, there were bed bugs crawling on the pillow. I had never seen one before but a quick search on my phone confirmed their identity. I called house keeping right away and they sent up a security guard that collected the bugs in little baggies. They sent up a bell hop to carry my things to my new room in the old unrenovated tower (downgrade). The security guard said you need to wash those clothes as soon as possible in hot water. I happened to agree. I had one more night to stay at the LVH and I in NO WAY wanted to transport those nasty creatures back to my home in FL. When I got to my new room and I made a call to find out about laundry services. I was passed around to about 4 different people before someone was able to tell me if my clothes could be laundered. House keeping passed me to the Bell hop, bell hop passed me to housekeeping. To make a long story short. It was the epitome of unorganized. Aside from the security guard saying one time, "Sorry for the inconvenience". That was the only time I was apologized to. I realize accidents happen and those bugs are a problem that hotels sometimes run into but I was shocked at how management did barely the minimum. A simple call from the manager with an apology would have gone a long way. But instead no apology as well as no compensation for my troubles, not only was a charged the full amount of the room and resort fees....I was also charged for one of the keurig coffee kits (I don't even drink coffee). This hotel was a huge disappointment, I will not be staying here again. Even though it is the most convenient to the convention center, I don't think poor customer service like I experienced, should be rewarded. Unfortunately, because of the trade shows and proximity to the center, I think they get much more business than they deserve. They have given up on customer service because of guaranteed business they get from the trade shows.
1833	1	This place is worth a five star rating!  Not all of Gordon restaurants are equal in quality but this steakhouse is a notch above!!  Had the Beef Wellington and the cauliflower curry soup!!  Both were excellent and flavorful and as other reviewers have said, the service was first class !!
