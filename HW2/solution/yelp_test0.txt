It only tasted okay when I dipped it in a sauce. I didn't even wanna eat it after I got a box for it and brought it with me back to my hotel.   The next day, I went back again before the end of my trip. I ordered the chili since I was starting to feel sick from the whole weekend. After eating half of the bowl, I couldn't finish it because it was so spicy. It was very good though, since it had filet mignon chunks in it. But the spice was just too overwhelming.   Next time, I'll just have the frozen hot chocolate and that's it. I'm done giving their food more chances, only to be let down on more than one occasion.
279	0	First time trying this place. The things I liked are the sides bar (pasta, salad, mashed potatoes). I didn't like that we were charged for fancy "bottled" water that we didn't know about until the bill came and noticed the bottle was already opened and my cousin said it tasted like tap water. So since we paid for it we asked could we take the bottle and we were told "sure for $12" we passed.   Then we were told there was 12 different selections of meat we counted about 8 and really only had about 3 (ham, tri tip, ny steak) ham was the best to be honest. We didn't like rare or medium rare so we waited quite a long time to get ours well done. So after waiting for awhile we just called it quits. I don't think it's worth the price luckily we had a buy one get one free but still seemed too pricey for what you get. Safe to say my first and last visit.

LUCY, who I believe might be the manager (hostess) kept telling us different things. We were a party of 12. One minute we have a Table and next minute, We DON'T..!! Our Tables were taken by a Seven Stars or Diamond Card Holder..  THE FOOD WAS NOT WORTH IT..!!!!! The Wait or the Lies Left a Bad Taste in My Mouth..!!  I Don't Think I Will Be Coming Back... :(
545	1	This place is hidden behind the clear/silver elevator across from STK.  It's not on any maps & it's down a hallway.  They had the best think crust pizza.  If you don't like pizza sauce they have a "white" slice and it has no tomato sauce.  Just cheese & garlic.  It's only $3.50 for a slice, however the soda in a red cup is the SAME price.  I thought that was a bit  much.  As soon as you come up the escalator stay straight ahead and you'll see it .
109	0	Upon exiting, I look for the Riviera Casino and Hotel. It appears that our GPS is guiding us to the slums. Moments, we are driving to a very old section of Las Vegas. I don't mind that classic feel, but when it's no longer maintained and businesses appear to be gone as well, it's quite depressing.  Arrival to the Riviera... .... ....  I've driven over 4 hours to arrive to a line with at least 50 people, so I'm sorta expecting a fun and entertaining counter to get my mood swinging UP! Check-in counter employees do not appear happy or mad, but they are quite depressing to deal with. They seem to be sick of their job.   I will never reserve a room here again. It is bad. My non-smoking room smelled so bad, I felt healthier breathing in the casino floor and/or hallways! The AC couldn't be adjusted to be comfortable, so it was either blistering cold A/C or hot HEAT. The unit didn't seem to be drawing fresh air either. The standard room's bathroom is small, and I couldn't hang my towels because the hanging mounts were all broken. The toilet barely flushes. The sink water has strong pressure, at least. The 1950's had it very well, but they can no longer compete with casinos on the strip. I would book Circus Circus before giving this place another shot.  I should have snapped a picture of the air filter (they actually have one!!) located inside our room. Last I checked, filters are meant to be replaced, not in continuous service while the white filter media is BLACK!!!!!!!!!  Why did I book this? It was the cheapest rate at the time (still above $120). However, it is off the strip, very depressing, and just not a place to dwell. The casino floors, however, was active and appears OK. They had one (1) Pai Gow table on a Saturday (9th) November, and people playing that night (8PM to 4AM Sunday) all received a FAT 5-ACES bonus for betting on the ENVY. 4 players received $1,000, and the 5-ACES hand landed on the Dragon Hand.  You would not believe the PIT BOSSES faces. They made us feel that we didn't deserve to win. They scrutinized the dealer at the time of win, and came back to ask more questions 3 hours later (after shift rotation)! Unfortunately, they weren't expecting to payout that much on a single Pai Gow table and it was clear that they were hurting that night.   At the cashier, I was asked "where did you win all this money"? I mean they were all on high alert since the table payout was $4,000 in bonus payout, and many bonuses throughout the period.  I will never stay here again, but  I would play at their casino floor, hoping for another good bonus flop!
604	1	Came here for brunch this past Saturday.  My cranky pants best friend was getting really cranky cause the coffee took a bit long to get to us and the food took even longer.  Anyways, places like this likes to deliver entrees to everyone at the same time and we had a party of 11.  I got the croquette madame and he got the chicken and waffles.  My entree was delicious and their fries were perfection.  His chicken was mediocre but the waffles and maple syrup was delicious! We also got a side order of the sausage and apple wood bacon.  Both were so good.  Together the both of us, it was $70.  Not too bad. Definitely want to return to try their dinner menu.
1591	0	The Food here is not any better than the other Buffets in Vegas. But they run a ridiculous system here. They close down the buffet between meals.   On the day of my visit, We where outside lining up to get in. I saw no signs that they close between meals. No staff to attend to customers. Only an enclosure placed in front of the escalator.  We where the first few people in front of the line for we arrived 9 45 am. By 10:30 a cashier came up taking customers. So we paid for the meal hoping we going to have lunch soon.  To my surprice another line was being formed downstairs. No one was seating the customers. So we had to wait another 30 min to get to our tables.   This is truly stupid coz lunch is more expensive than breakfast. There is no point of making people wait if they have paid for lunch during breakfast hour.  I asked the server why such a system. She told me that employees takes there break during these times. In other words, the buffet is understaff.  I tell you the food is no better than any great Vegas buffet. Go somewhere else. Its not worth the wait.
779	0	Clean and sterile like an operating room.....  Such a strange feeling to walk into Lee's Sandwiches, which is not quite a yogurt store, grocery store, or a sandwich shop, but some type of odd mixture.  There are overpriced "Imported from France" goods for sale on a few shelves throughout the store.  It's a random selection of cookies, teas, and other things you probably wouldn't buy when you're cruising for a sandwich.  The yogurt machines are on the wall, like you would see at a yogurt store, but I'm not sure about the topping selection; it looked sparse at best.   Now, onto the sandwiches.  The menu on the wall above the registers is big and colorful.  The pictures look exactly like the sandwiches do, which normally would be a great thing, but here it's a disappointment.  I went with the BBQ Pork sandwich.  These are in the style of Bhan Mi, but really subpar.  The bread is missing that great crisp you expect from a baguette.  The flavor of the sandwich was muted as well, and even biting into big slices of jalapenos and bunches of cilantro I couldn't really get into the sandwich.    There is now a $10 CC minimum if you plan on using plastic, but really, you're better off just going somewhere else.
968	0	They really need to re-evaluate on having a buffet.   With so much history, at the MGM Grand and this is what they have to offer. It's rather disappointing and I would say the worst buffet in Vegas I've had in the 10 years I've been coming to Vegas. Either they don't listen to the reviews or they just don't care. To me it's ruining MGM's image and unacceptable.  The food quality is below par with the exception of the desserts which is slightly better. Everthing was either overcooked, or dry. The atmosphere reminds me one of those $11.99 Chinese buffet. Never again.
539	0	Not a fine dining of course, it's more of a causal grab a bit kind of place. The Singaporean noodle was good. Spring rolls were average. I expected a bit more from the place in terms of food quality in lieu of it being in Bellagio. PS mango pudding was okay too!
167	0	The air filtration system in the rooms are in poor condition. On two occasions of my stay here at the hotel, both times my room smelled like wet mops and mildew. I awoke coughing after an uncomfortable rest in a room that's scent choked my lungs.  The lobby staff IS friendly and aside of that, the rooms are , at most, barely tolerable.
84	1	I'm keeping this review short since there are so many to review from.  Service - 5 stars Food - 5 stars Price - 4 stars (a bit pricey but you get what you pay for so to speak)  We were recently in Vegas celebrating my boy's bachelor party.  We came in with a party of 10 and were instantly greeted and seated.  They gave us some pistachios and bread to start with.  Try the bread with a little butter and their home made mustard.  The combo sounds kinda weird, but it's killer!  To warm the taste buds, I ordered the cream of mushroom.  It was very tasty but nothing extraordinarily different.  However, for my main course, I ordered the sirloin steak sous vide with vegetables.  Mid order, I asked the waiter if I could swap the veggiies for fries.  He said, the order comes with the veggies but that he'd bring 3 baskets of fries for our group on the house.  And as for the steak, it was vacuumed sealed to capture the juices....and it definitely tasted that way.  Juiciest Sirloin ever!  Cooked to perfection and was super tasty.
573	1	Jeremy was our server and Scott had no problem jumping in to help. Theses two guys were fabulous. They were friendly and attentive. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was perfect for my 9 years old. We've been here quite a few times, but the service this time was definitely something to yelp about. We will continue to return to this restaurant.
1780	1	- The Skinny:  Food Quality: 5 Stars -  Great pizza! Get the Meatball, Pepperoni, or their most popular slice, "The White".    Meatball - Large slices of Meatball and globs of ricotta cheese.  Pepperoni - Large slices of real pepperoni, makes pizza chains seem like they are using intimidation pepperoni?     "The White" - its all cheese, fresh ricotta, and garlic sauce. There is no pizza sauce on that one but trust me, its good! My wife loves Chicago Deep Dish Pizza and dislikes NY style, but this was the best pizza she ever had.   Pricing: 5 Stars - $5 a slice, if you're hungry, get 2 slices as they are large, but thin (NY style). It costs more than other pizza joints but factor in that it's located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel.   Service: 3 Stars - Nothing incredible but it is just a pizza counter and they are just mashing out pizzas. The workers were friendly and helped me choose some good slices. There is a little bit of a wait but its worth it!  Atmosphere: 5 Stars - Has a real NY pizza place feel. A couple pinball machines and some TV's playing sports. Hallway is decorated with vintage vinyl records and adds some class but once its opens up to the pizza counter, its straight NY style!   Place is really a secret, I had to ask 3 different hotel employees to find it. Its a hallway that is missed in a blink. Its to the left of glass elevator and across from the "game lounge" (pool table, scrabble coffee tables, wooden dice seats).   Comfort: 3 Stars - It's a narrow hallway any little counter space to eat, but you will be there just to buy and run so no worries there.   Location: 3 Stars trying to find it but as far as theme goes (being a secret, 5 Stars) - Place is really a secret, I had to ask 3 different hotel employees to find it. Its a hallway that is missed in a blink. Its to the left of glass elevator and across from the "game lounge" (pool table, scrabble coffee tables, wooden dice seats). With a name like "Secret Pizza", mission accomplished!   - The Fat:   My in-laws were in town and of course we needed to take them out to the Vegas Strip. There was 25 of us so no need for a sit down dinner, especially with many small children. I found "Secret Pizza" on Yelp and opt'ed to go there as we made our way to the Bellagio fountain show.   It was tricky to find, had to use my GPS and ask 3 hotel employees to get there but it really is a hidden treat. You will have to wait a little bit, I was there on a Sat night around 11pm and we waited about 20-30 mins?  The pizza is delicious! hot, fresh, and kills any other pizza I had, only rivaled by Grimaldi's Pizza in NY under the Brooklyn bridge. I would go out of my way to go here again. If you are on the strip and want fast, inexpensive, but quality food, go to Secret Pizza!!!
1930	0	Gone downhill recently. No 'fish' at the fishmonger - only cheap crab. Pasta chef never knew what basic dishes were and the selection all round was on the lower end of the scale.  I guess the Mirage hotel is trying to appeal to the budget customer and sets product choice to match.
112	1	Everytime I'm in Vegas I have to eat here. I always order the farm burger and the jalapeo poppers this this is the second time I have the hod burger and first time was good but plain. They now made it much better and now preffered over the farm burger. Not comes with jog patty, hog bacon and hog bbq pulled hog with so much melty cheese
830	0	The name says it all. THIS should be your last resort.  We walked by this restaurant many times before deciding to go, it looked like a load of fun, the food was okay, not the greatest.   The biggest problem I had with this restaurant was the server, yes I know that you're supposed to get sarcastic service here and he was mouthy, which was great. But aside from being pretty much ignored most the time, even though he pretty much just wandered around most the time.   Near the end of our meal these two girls came in he sat there at the bar talking to them, he completely ignored us after that and he also had another large table of probably seven people, they had to bug him for their bill.   The second problem I had with this was the drinks, I bought the large margarita in the souvenir glass and yes I did order the extra shot, it came out so strong I couldn't drink it. My husband did but I did bring it up to the server that it was incredibly strong and bitter, not complaining mind you just to let them know and all he said was well he ordered the extra shot didn't you?  So all in all, this was not a very good meal save yourself some money and go else where. we wish we would have
979	0	My husband and I decided to play "tourist" on the Memorial Day weekend.  We started to Planet Hollywood's Miracle Mile Shops.  While walking thru the shops, we decided to share a yard margarita.  (If we wanted to play tourists, we had to look the part!)  Fat Tuesdays had a line down the hall and around the corner!  So we thought we'd see what else was in the shops.  We thought we were lucky because just as we were about to walk out of the shops, Cabo Wabo Cantina appears with a margarita/daiquiri stand.  We end up getting the  1/2 yard with a strawberry margarita.  The first couple sips, neither of us said anything.  I didn't care for the drink so I stopped drinking it.  About 2 minutes later, my husband looks at me and says "Doesn't this taste a little funny?"   Yes!  It tasted like a watered down slushie/virgin margarita!  We decided to salvage the drink...went to ABC Store, bought Bacardi's Cherry flavor and poured a couple shots in there.  It tasted much better after that.  All and all...the drink cost over $30 (between the cost of the  1/2 yard at Cabo Wabo, tip, and ABC liquor purchase).  Will we go back?  Heck NO!  I'll wait in line at Fat Tuesdays or skip the drink next time.  PS:  This struck me as very strange....Our server at Cabo Wabo was counting her tips.  And not just quickly going thru the cash and then waiting on us.  She was pretending to be interested in us while she was counting out her money.  We told her our drink order and she gave us the "deer in the headlights" look with a blank smile!  She wasn't paying attention to one word we said!  We repeated our order, she recounted her money then got us our drink.  Not sure why it was so important to count her money so intensely but it was kinda weird!
359	1	I seriously dream about this pizza.   On my last few trips to Vegas, Secret Pizza has been one of my first stops every time. One slice is never enough (even though they are HUGE.)  As a pizza connoisseur, I vote that this is the best of the best. You will not be disappointed I promise. And if you are, then we can't be friends.
1207	0	I remember MGM Grand as one of the best hotel/casinos on the strip, and now it's just, ugh, or eh.  Their buffet is horrific and their casino had this horrible vanilla smell mixed with like tobacco, just wasn't a good look.  I won't even mention the crowds just because I understand, it's Vegas in the middle of the afternoon, whatever.  My husband and I literally waited for our car at valet for as long as we spent eating at their buffet, but the valet attendant was very sweet, so 1 star for him. I just don't know what happened to this place.
680	1	I grew up in Montana. I know a good burger when I sink my teeth into it. Imagine my surprise when the best burger I've ever had the opportunity to experience (at a restaurant,) came from Vegas.  The kobe beef burger is worth every penny. The service is great, Sin City beer is good. There can be a bit of a wait, depending on when you get there, but it's worth it.  Doesn't quite compare to the fresh burgers my dad used to make, but it comes damn close.  If you love burgers, you have to check out the Burger Bar.
229	0	It sounds like a lot of people like the French Onion soup. Well, on the contrary, my cousin wasn't satisfied with his French Onion Soup at all. He took about 3 sips and gave up on it. I don't know if he's just picky, it was a bad day for french onion soup, or it's really just not that great.   I ordered the turkey pot pie. POT PIE? I love pot pies. I think it was the special of the day, so I gave it no second thought and ordered it. The first thing I thought to myself upon seeing my pot pie was, "UMMMMM, is this the right order? This looks like a croissant wannabe over a well of pea and turkey soup." Okay, I might be describing it worse than it actually is. Check out the picture I posted and judge for yourself. The presentation was nice, but wasn't at all how I imagined it. I dug into the puff pastry hoping to find lobster, but it was just more...puff pastry. =[ Boy was I bummmmmmmed. If only all the peas and turkey bits were INSIDE of the puff pastry..it didn't even taste that great, hence the 2 stars.   I won't come back unless I'm really hungry at night and everything else is closed-why? It's open 24/7.
1178	1	Unbelievably, Incredibly Good  I'll spare you a lengthy read.  I came up with the crazy idea to take my wife to one of her favorite restaurants for her birthday.  We flew from San Francisco to Las Vegas to have lunch here.  AND IT WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT!!  We will do it again.  It was our second meal there - every bit as good as the first.  The location is not great, but the food is utterly amazing.  EAT HERE.
1839	1	Awesome place!! I looked this place up in YELP but was a little scared of the neon lighting and drinks shown in the first couple of pictures ONLY because I was traveling with my husband and our eight month old baby. Thought it would be more of a lounge than a restaurant. But I asked over at the Wynn where would they recommend a great restaurant for breakfast and they mention "Peppermill". I was then convinced and headed over. When walking in you can't help but see the neon lights and the purple furnishings. But once you actually sit down and your food comes to the table you enjoy the ambiance with the delicious food. Very good, would recommend and come here again!
1420	0	Came here with a 2-4-1 MyVegas coupon for brunch so the price was great, but the food was okay and service was spotty at best.   Large assortment for brunch, especially for dessert. The sushi before 10am freaked me out so I steered clear. Nothing was all that memorable from this meal except for the poor service (I had to get up and ask the waiters standing around chatting to get a refill on drinks).
1550	1	You won't be disappointed!!!  It was simply great!!'  A bit of a wait but totally worth it   The Shack Stack is super good along with the smoke shack  The prices were about $6 a single and $9-10 for a double / shack stack.  Big seating area  Lives up to its hype!
1330	1	A consistently excellent dining experience.  Though Thomas Keller has probably not set foot in the place for years, his aura clearly remains in the service and attention to detail.  Little things like the bread and butter are excellent, but Keller goes one step further throwing in a handful of still-warm house-roasted pistachios.    I played it safe this time, having my favorites-- oysters to start and the steak frites entree.  Both were excellent as usual.  Everyone else enjoyed their meals as well.  The only negative s something they have no control over-- the customers-- decked out in flip-flops, way-too-short-shorts, or obnoxiously loud shirts.  Ahhh Vegas.  P.S.  The breakfast and brunch rock as well.
997	1	Pro: Cheesecake factory done right, TONS of seats, great food, excellent breakfast buffet. 24 hours!!!  Con: Back of the Venetian, can still be crowded during major conventions.  This is it, skip all your buffets and $150 dollar per person meals, come here and dine. The menu is long and detailed, from small to epic portions, everything is done right from 6 am to 9 pm. I have personally ate here 3 times while in those ungodly hours and everything is just done to perfection.   The breakfast buffet is a quick service option, most time is when my crew are here for CES, skip the wait, and go get your own food. The fruit is always the highlight, it's just better than the $33 dollars Caeser/Aria buffet.   If the place is packed, go eat at the bar, the service there is sometimes better.
972	1	I went here with high hopes and was not in the slightest bit disappointed. The waitstaff was very helpful and polite. Our waiter brought by a cart of meat to show us the cuts and explained them to us. We were started with a variety of breads served with smoked salt butter. They were terrific. I ordered the filet and it was great. I've been to other steakhouses and this was to die for. Had haricot vert on the side. It was tempura fried but a little greasy. Probably wouldn't order it again, but it wasn't terrible. Also had the creamed spinach on the side which was pretty good. I almost died and went to heaven when I was served dessert. I ordered the sticky toffee pudding and it was the best thing I've EVER eaten. I would go back a million times just to eat this dessert!!! I left here stuffed full but wanting to eat more! Will definitely go back in the future.
1610	0	This place is absolutely horrible. If asked o honestly couldn't think of a worse experience I've ever had at a restaurant. I usually don't write reviews because I generally feel like each persons experience is always different. Sometimes it can be the waiter or just a bad thing you ordered and some people want to give the place one star for it. Well this isn't that. This place is genuinely the worst restaurant I've ever been in. And I've been to A LOT. It was my wife and I's 5th year anniversary and we picked this place out of any other in Vegas because it sounded fun and like it had a huge variety. We wanted a place somewhere around 25-30 a plate so that we knew it'd be good food but still affordable. We had a reservation for 9 which means that each person had to spend a minimum of $25 dollars as well as a mandatory 18% gratuity added to the bill. We get there and have to wait an hour to be seated. We told them it was our 5 year anniversary and wanted it to be special. I guess special to them is a small table with 9 seats around it right by the front door when they have parties of about 4 taking up giant booths. Anyways, I finally order and get their $23 fried chicken meal - it was worse than literally a fried chicken made in a TV dinner. The mashed potatoes had the viscosity of water with a little bit of sand in it. HORRIBLE. We tell them our displeasure with our experience and are told "were sorry you feel that way", the end. I would never suggest this place to anyone in my life and I hope this place goes under and everyone that works there can never find a job in the food service industry again.
1683	0	Zero stars, ya digggg. 1 star because i had to. This place is the shitter hole. I tried 2 other LV Buffets, and take my advice: GO STRAIGHT TO the Wicked Spoon Buffet at The Cosmopolitan. Best gosh darn food, ginormous selections, and great service. All the sites say it's the best, and hands down, it is.   Mandalay Bayside Buffet had the worst crap to eat + shittt service. So bad that we asked to talk to the manager, and she didnt do anything about our experience. NO one cleared our tables the whole hour we were there. When we walked personally to get the managers attention, she was snooty towards us. SAYONARA MAH DUDES won't be giving you a 2nd chance because of your uncaring restaurant presence. So many other choices, you should be on top of your game.   Waste of my hard earned Vegas money.
1700	1	Went here about a month ago.. Atmosphere Is like you're living on the set of the golden girls which I absolutely love! The food was great I had the eggs Benedict probably the best eggs Benedict I have had in a while.  The only thing that I have to complain about is the wait it took for us to be seated... Have no fear they have a full bar and fire pit to keep you entertained while you wait... James the bartender was AMAZING!!!!! He had great recommendations and was up for the challenge of being our bartender!!!! Overall, this was a great place and I will definitely be back!
805	1	The wife and I came here for lunch and we were very impressed! The restaurant had a hip, stylish vibe with the fire decor in the front. Great menu with plenty of more-than-basic options to choose from. I ordered the fish and chips sandwich which was great! She ordered a jalapeo burger and truffle fries which were amazing as well. Only down fall was the two drunk idiots that sat down at our table and started making out.... WTH JUST HAPPENED! The waitress asked if they were with us and quickly got them out HAHA maybe have a railing around the outside table so no one thinks that there's open seating??? Other than the drunken stupidity, I loved every bit of it and definitely recommend going!
537	0	Was with a group of business colleagues for a pre-set meal. The service was excellent, but the food left a lot to be desired. Chicken Piccata was flavorless and served on a bed of pasta that was even more bland. Others shrugged off their food (steak and Cannelloni)with a "Meh, not so good." I had expected much better.  Chocolate raspberry cake was yummy.
114	0	When it comes to Lee's Sandwiches, I'll guess the answer is I'll have to come back in a few months to see if they're doing anything differently.    Unlike a few other Yelpers who have had a Lee's Sandwich experience before, I've never been to this chain and really wanted to go as soon as they opened.  I really like banh mi and wanted to see if this place stacked up to other local establishments.  Unfortunately the service was super slow (perhaps due to being relatively new) and the sandwiches were not up to par.  I found them to be REALLY skimpy on the toppings as there were quite a few bites of my charbroiled pork sandwich that consisted of just bread and pickled carrots. I brought a bunch of friends with me to try it out and their sandwiches were equally..."empty".  I hope they understand that my desire to go to Lee's was to try them for the first time and not to show them a great place to eat.  As with some other places to eat here in Vegas, Lee's seems to be one of those places that is good just because it's open.  The quality is not there, we experienced really slow service and the sandwiches are skimpy.  I like the baguettes but there are better if I'm willing to drive to them.   Overall, not the best, but something to eat if you need to soak up some alcohol after a night of going out.  As I'm a cab driver, I'll probably never go there for that reason so I guess I'll go back in about 6 months to see if they've gotten any better.   Before I forget, it seems that Lee's has an abundance of ice as their drinks (coffee, iced tea or soft drinks) are mostly ice.  Make sure you don't get thirsty here as their drinks are mostly comprised of ice and you could end up spending a fortune to quench your thirst!  Maybe that will make the sandwiches seem like a better deal?
686	1	We went to Burgr for dinner on a Sunday evening.  There was 20 minute wait to be seated. It seems to be popular.  As a vegetarian I was not keep on a burger joint and the menu has only 1 burger for vegetarians, the Earth Burger ( portabello mushroom burger ). I am not a fan of portabello mushroom, the kitchen obliged me with a grilled cheese with veggies and their mango chutney.  It was fantastic. I would recommend that again. The staff was courteous and accomodating and so was the kitchen staff. Do give it a try, even if you are vegetarian.
1759	1	All I can say about this place is HUGE portions that can be shared with a lot of people. Gotta try their famous Andy's sage waffle and chicken. That sucker is huge and inside the waffle, it has bits of bacon. Yes, I said bacon. Bacon lovers get the chicken and waffle!  Every time I go here I always get good service and nothing bad seems to happen. They have set hours for breakfast/lunch and dinner. They close for about 2 and a half hours to get their dinner situated.   Very good place to eat your heart out. Go there hungry.
288	0	Went here last night for my cousins birthday dinner. The atmosphere was cool, the live music was good and the slide they have inside the restaurant was fun for the kiddos. The food however...not so good. It's pretty pricy and on the chicken dish my sister got there was nothing but fat, and I tried one of my grandmother's BBQ ribs and there was barely any meat at all on those either. Definitely not worth the $20 a plate... Probably the only sweet thing about the food was the cotton candy they bring you at the end. Even the biscuits they serve you at the beginning were cold and crumbly. Then at the end the server was even allowed to split up the check! We had to figure it out ourselves. All I can say is I was not impressed...
1138	1	Ugh this place is so good. I'm somewhat glad this place is 4+ hours away since I would just get fat going here.  Service Super attentive ! Water was always filled and I didn't have to raise my hand for too long if I needed something. Bae and I came here without a reservation on a Saturday (they only serve dinner at 5:30pm on weekends) and sat in a line for maybe 8min at most.  Food - garlic prawns.  What is there to say ? Incredibly flavorful, buttery and garlicky and I don't even know what else I'm eating but I just know my tongue is super happy. Bae and I got maybe 8 prawns and we still had leftovers - boat noodle soup (combination beef noodle soup/#109) Holy this is prolly my fav thing here other than the prawns. So incredibly flavorful and it almost makes me cry from whatever flavors my tongue is experiencing. Kicks my hometown Thai place's boat noodle soup out of the water. Honestly this doesn't even need the vermicelli noodles. If you get this with the beef and the bean sprouts, in combination with the amazing broth, you won't even miss the noodles. Get this. - khao soi Egg noodles in a light curry sauce with beef topped with crispy egg noodles. This was a tad hair shorter in the flavor department compared to the boat noodle soup, but with a squeeze of lime, it elevated the flavor tenfold. Pretty good, kind of a small portion. - nam kao tod (crispy fried rice) If you're looking for a flavor explosion with a bit of a crunch, I'd recommend this. Filled with crispy rice (how do they do it...), peanuts, a healthy dose of lime, sour pork sausage, red onions, I'm sure fish sauce, peanuts and other stuff, this is a party in your mouth. Compared to Vientiane (garden grove), this place stands it's ground for crispy rice. Bae kept looking up and pondering how this made his tastebuds flip. - mango sticky rice I love sticky rice and bae has never had mango sticky rice, so this was perfect. The rice seemed a little hard (chewier) than other ones I had, but it also had a fragrant jasmine taste to it. The mangoes were the small ones and it was an ample amount. Sweet and yummy, bae ate the whole thing.
1545	1	We came here Friday night, i was expecting they would be really busy, but when we got there, it was just enough people, not too busy but not slow.. We got sat right away, we got the gangnam set and it was so much food, it says its for party of 2, but i think it's a lot of food just for two people unless you're a big eater.. Lol..service was really good too, and overall experience it was good..:-) we'll be back for sure..
39	0	Nothing to write home about.  Fancy noodle guy making the them from scratch. ....but the window dressing really didn't match or meet expectations.  In fact, a trip to Panda Express would have saved me $70 and we would have had a better meal.    Never again!
1199	1	Oh, wow.  Where to start?  This is a Las Vegas institution.  When I was a dealer at the old Sahara, we used to go here after work at 3:00 AM for an omelet and champagne.  The fireside lounge is kitchy, old-school Vegas, but the bar staff are great and the mixologists build great drinks.  Oh, and did I mention the food is tasty, reasonably priced, and there's a lot of it?  If you're on the strip and need a good meal at a good price, or you want to sit back and relax in a nice lounge and enjoy a beverage, this is THE place to go.
1284	1	This is the best Korean restaurant I've ever been!!!!!!!! The side dishes are great; the appetizers are awesome; the BBQ meat is so fresh and juicy.   We ordered steamed egg, chicken karage, and tuna kimbap for starters. Omgosh, they were all a fantastic. We ordered scallops, Korean prime kalbi, sweet corn, and enoki with bacon. I have never had such great kalbi before. The meat is so juicy and palatable, and I ate the meat with the sesame veggies in the house... it's like a taste of heaven.   Recommend recommend recommend!!!!
1008	1	Everyone is sooooo nice here. The customer service is great and of course the food is amazing. Not only will I be coming back as much as possible I will recommend it to my friends. I'm not a huge beef person but I got the lonely bird which was recommended to me and it is more than delicious. Milkshake infused alcohol is amazing as well. Everything is just so perfect about this place.
61	0	Went for breakfast and waited forever at the front for the rude hostess to even look at us.  Some bitchy granny seated is and lectured us about the dos and don'ts of eating breakfast.  Breakfast buffet was $16.00.  Because everything was not to my liking, I basically left there hungry.  The bacon was like chewing on plastic with artificial bacon flavoring.  The eggs were...(I have no words for them).  The only edible things were the fruits as they did not require cooking.  It was THE MOST DISGUSTING BREAKFAST I HAVE EVER HAD and so not worth $16. I had breakfast buffet at Mandalay Bay the previous day and it was awesome.   Do not eat here unless you have no other option. Between the disgusting food and the unfriendly staff, I can not understand why this dump exists in the basement of the hotels, which smells like a backed up sewer, by the way.
348	1	I wished this place existed when I attended UNLV. This place carries a lot of value with the amount of different (yet satisfying) portions/packages that even a poor college student can afford.  My friend and I got the most basic Las Vegas package since we're hungry but obviously not capable of eating a feast by ourselves. It was $45/person and the amount of food cannot be more fulfilling. You get the tradition side dishes + a house salad, along with rice, sauces and miso soup to go along with your proteins that includes beef, spicy chicken, garlic shrimp and pork.  You are however required to cook things yourself comparing to places like Honey Pig when a server would occasionally stop by and manage your food. The place wasn't busy at the time we were dining so the servers volunteered to rotate our proteins for us as we were engaged in a deep conversation catching up on life- What a nice touch.   The ambiance of this place is on the smaller size but comfortable at the least. The service was friendly and attentive and most importantly, the food was amazing for the price that you're paying. I wasn't sure if it was Happy Hour when we dined but when we received our tab, it only came out to be $55. A lot less from what I was expected to pay (hey I'm not complaining) but regardless of it being a mistake or not, I'll happily return.
274	0	MEH.  I stayed here over labor day weekend (I'm checking out as we speak) and I was not impressed at all. The lobby still looks like it did in the 90s. The gift shop is not remotely up to par with many of the other local hotels. Pretty sure the ugliest shirts ever are sold there and they haven't remodeled since I was 12.  I stayed on the 25th floor. The rooms were updated since the 90s but for some reason they couldn't spend the $20 to cover up the hole between the front door and the carpet.  That being said, I can hear AND feel anytime someone nearby walks by or closes/opens their door. This is absurd for a hotel that is supposedly high end. The doors don't seem to be shut solid so it also shakes anything a door is closed.   So if you need a hotel in Vegas but don't plan on sleeping this is your place to be. Just make sure you don't pay a lot of $ for your room. They don't charge for wifi which is nice at least.
70	0	The customer service was very nasty!! I will never go here again and will pass the word on to friends and family!! I never would have expected to watch some as whole throw my food into the bag because the cashier as whole didn't confirm that it was and order to GO!  Got into a verbal confutation with the lady who threw my food in the bag!!.. Since I didn't have bail$$ I let her keep her teeth...  A little encouragement to the as whole lady please find yourself another job if you're unhappy with the Hot Dogs business!! The Original Pinks is in Los Angeles Ca. a much better place to go and eat a hot dog and know the customer service there has better class.
857	0	Please don't ever come here! If you love your family do not eat at this place. First things first walking in is the horrible smell. It smells like the inside of a nursing home. No lie. Secondly they do not have a person coming around taking your dirty plates, they will sit on your table for a while in the way of your food. Third it's in the ghetto which would be okay if they had good food and customer service which they do not. Inside gives you the feel that a fight can break out and end up on world star and any moment. And last but not least when we were finished eating sitting and talking about how we will never come here again we see one of the workers cleaning the Buffett area and putting all the food that drops around the sides BACK IN WITH THE OTHER FOOD. I am so traumatized
1736	1	Come here with an empty stomach and an appetite or be prepared to take some food home. The portions are huge! The breakfast menu is one of the most diverse that I've ever encountered. 4-egg omelettes and scrambles seem to be the rule in Las Vegas. The Egg & I omelettes were delicious and loaded with cheese. We had a veggie omelette and a veggie scramble. The potatoes were seasoned just right. Reading prior Yelp reviews beforehand, I doubted that the banana nut muffins could live up to the hype. Boy was I wrong. Excellent. Fluffy and not too heavy on the banana. Prepare for a large crowd and a wait on the weekend. The hostesses were very pleasant and friendly. The bus staff too. And our server, Tamara, was a delight.
1065	1	Holy crap where do I start??? Tldr: if you're reading this, just go there as soon as you can.   We went on a Sunday morning, for a lazy brunch and that's exactly what it was.   The menu options are EXTENSIVE. Lots of sweet and savory options. We ordered the Brad's Scramble and Waffle with a banana nut muffin on the side. I'd read tons of reviews about the muffin so I wanted to know what the hype was all about.   And I was BLOWN AWAY. This is one of the yummiest, tastiest muffins I've had in my life. And this set the bar really, really high for me.   Then the waffle - with a nice layer of whipped cream and blueberries was perfect.   Scrambled eggs were great as well. The potatoes were really excellent! Cooked perfectly and coated with the Hablo Diabla spice, not too spicy - just right.   When we went to settle the check, there was a mixup and they charged us with someone else's bill. But they handled the situation well, and fixed the goof up very humbly.   The staff was always nice and sweet.   This is in stark comparison to the fancier places we dined over the weekend, where the staff was very curt and hostile at best.   Will definitely come back, just for those muffins awww man.
1746	1	We had dinner here at midnight. At that hour, you kind of expect mediocre service and food to kind of just get you by. This was one of the best burgers I've had. I had a turkey burger and it was perfection. At first the fact that it was topped with blueberry compote sounded odd, but it worked so so well. Our truffle fries were fresh and fantastic, and my friends blue cheese burger was great.  A little pricey for a burger from the outset, but keep in mind it goes with Vegas prices, and you're eating GR creations.  Would definitely recommended for any occasion!
1293	0	Booked hotel room through Orbitz and received Complimentary Breakfast/Brunch.    Noticed the low star ratings but since it was Free Breakfast/Brunch, Sure, why not!  The food here is Bleh...    Prices for breakfast and brunch ranges from $17.25-$25.99...NOT WORTH IT!  Trust me, Go elsewhere!    Most of the items were cold, hard and dry...Yuck!  The worst is the eggs benedict, OMG Disgusting!  If you must eat here, stick with the strawberries n creme, chips w/ taco meat, bacon, string beans and asparagus...  ******************* Apparently, MGM Grand charged us for the Breakfast/Brunch buffets.  When we checked in, the front desk clerk told us it was included with the room.  We are currently in the process of disputing the charges. They have yet to return our calls or emails...  ******************** Update: After weeks of phone calls and emails, MGM finally credited us back the excessive charges (7/11/13).  It shouldn't have taken this long...
498	0	This place is way overrated! There was a long line to get in and once our group got in we noticed that the club was not even full. I included some of the many reasons to avoid this god forsaken place.  Reason #1 :  As a female I did not have to pay to get in but my male friends had to pay 30 bucks! Now looking back I wouldn't pay 5 cents to get in!  Reason #2: After about an hour the club started getting full to the point we couldn't move and the stupid bouncers kept telling us to move because we were blocking the way! We couldn't move because there were way too many people everywhere.  Reason #3: The DJ sucked..playing little snips of top 40 hits..lame. Reason #4: Unless you reserve a table do not even plan to sit down and rest or have a drink because there is absolutely no where to sit. Reason #5: Our group got separated and my sister was given a date rape drug here..when she finally found a bouncer to help her he picked her up, carried her to the side of the strip and left her.   She couldn't get up and walk due to the drug she was given.  DO NOT GO HERE..There are  many other nightclubs and lounges in Vegas that are excellent and fun! Don't waste your time.
500	0	I have several bones to pick with this place.  1) The cashier really talked up the fact that you get free beer and wine with dinner.  Yeah, there are TWO wine choices and just ONE beer. 2) When I did get my beer (which happened to be a Bud Light), the guy at the drink station said that he didn't have limes but that I should ask my server.  I asked my server and the entire buffet did not stock limes.  WHAT KIND OF RESTAURANT DOESN'T HAVE LIMES??? 3) There was a Mexican food station and I got some taquitos (which ended up being crunchy but bland).  I ask the chef behind the neighboring station if they had sour cream or guacamole.  He looked at me as if I had asked him the meaning of life.  He had to call 2 other chefs over to confirm that no, they did not have guacamole (bummer!) and that the sour cream was likely in the salad bar. 4) I asked the lady at the dessert station if she could point me toward some desserts without nuts.  The only ones she pointed to were the sugar free ones.  At the time she was plating some type of chocolate cake and she held one piece of to her face and said "This one probably doesn't have nuts either."  And then she went about her business.  I am so sick of people not finding out for sure or just brushing off the question. I don't ask for fun...I ask because I will literally stop breathing and die if I eat nuts.  They did have some killer garlic mashed potatoes, so it's got that going for it.  Honestly, I love food and I am not that picky, but this place was just not good at all.  Just don't go here.
1449	1	My boyfriend and i love Gordon ramsey and all of his UK cooking shows, especially F word.  We were thrilled to be staying in Vegas at Paris where the new Gordon ramsey steak just opened. We shared the Caesar salad to start and Brian had the Strawberry martini. Best Caesar, great martini. Next we both had the Beef Wellington. Gamechanger! If you are in Vegas, stop reading this review and go to Gordon. The food is worth the price, and the waitstaff was fantastic as well. Olga from Siberia was a great waitress, I love a server with that right blend of spunk and professionalism, we had lots of fun! Overall, amazing experience and i will be dreaming about eating here again!  I can't say enough good things about Gordon, Yum!
1383	0	Used to go there often not so much since Shawn Eiferman isn't there playing music anymore. Food is ok, there used to be such a fun vibe that all the visitors would get into the action but now they have a guy from the Voice there and he is just kind of an arrogant guy and the drummer is a jerk.  Too bad they let Shawn go he was the showman, we follow him around Vegas and have for years and take our friends to hear him too. He is an entertainer that fills the house.
1844	1	I am traveling to Vegas for a convention. I also have Celiacs so I was afraid to eat anywhere for fear of being "Glutened". I was lucky to find this restaurant my first day here so I came back everyday for lunch. I am happy to say that the food was not only Delicious, but healthy for my food restrictions. The staff is really friendly and the atmosphere is casual but fun and clean. I highly recommend!
55	1	Went in with low expectations... Thinking it would be cheesy, expensive, mediocre food and small portions.  I was blown away on all accounts. Drinks were huge, portions were generous and the food was DELICIOUS and met the standards of a fine dining institution.   The Ramsay brand did not let down!  P.S. Beef Wellington FTW
1123	0	Okay, first of all. If you are going to charge that much money, you better try a little bit harder to make the food taste good. Almost $20 per person!!! They take advantage of the fact that they are on the strip and just charge extra for it. Maybe if they made better food it wouldn't be much a big deal for $20. The food was so bad that we were still hungry after we left because we couldn't finish it. Save yourselves the trouble (and money) and go somewhere else.
407	0	Let me start by saying that I did not have to pay for food at this buffet.  My hotel package included daily access, so this will give you some further perspective into my review.  Food: I found the food to be monotonous and bland.   The exception is the Prime Rib and the fresh crab legs.  Everything else was below average.  I did not pay for the food, and I was STILL disappointed.  With taxes included, dinner for two would run you about $55.  The food is definitely not worth the price.  Service: I found the service to be mediocre as well.  They line you by party size in one of 5 lines.  From far off, it is reminiscent of a cattle-line.  Apart from this, all the other patrons are hungry as hell and rude; due in part to the size of the lines and long wait times.  Cursing, cutting, and bumping seemed to be commonplace here.  I have received better service (and food) at Golden Corral.  In short, this place had no class at all.  You will certainly leave with the B-G's (Bubble Guts).
950	0	Food barn.  There is no ambiance to look at. Just carpeted floor, barely smiling hosts and mediocre food.  I don't think it's worth it even with the discount coupons. I would like to give this a higher rating but there is really nothing that stands out fromt heir offerings.  Cotton Candy and their Middle Eastern section is the only saving grace from another deduction.  Some say that there is quality. They may be eating from the floor then.   Sorry.
750	1	There was a short wait when we came on a Saturday around 2pm. It was only 10-15mins so it was not too bad. I wanted to order from the lunch menu but they don't have that option for weekends. However, they have the happy hour menu from 3-6pm, look good but I already over ordered from the regular menu. Onto the food, we got harami miso, Korean prime Kali, spicy tuna kimbap, fried calamari, bibimbap, and spicy tofu soup. Imo, everything was good, except the tofu soup. The meat cut was high quality, so tender and well seasoned. The appetizers are fried perfectly. Bibimbap was good, but at $12.99, i think I rather get another meat dish instead. The soup was just so so, not memorable.  The service was okay, no smile when greetings, but otherwise attentive. I would definitely visit again, with a reservation, since I don't like to wait an hour wait for any food.
1528	0	Can't think of much good to say about this place.  Don't go for food, and not sure I would recommend the bar either.  There was a smell of rancid trash that would waft out of the kitchen occasionally and the service was poor.    Unless you are a teenager or a college student that just wants to get drunk, avoid this place like the plague.
1828	1	First of all, you would NEVER know how to find this place unless you were specifically looking for it. It's off the strip in an area of town you wouldn't normally want to visit... I mean, unless you're interested in the transvestite strip club down the plaza. Who knows, maybe that's your thing? :)  Anyway... if you do happen to read a review or have someone in Vegas (a cab driver or another local?) recommend this place, it's for good reason... it's simply amazing.   You would never guess from the outside... or for that matter the interior (unless you examined ALL the celebrity pictures up and down the walls of course) that this place was in fact just simply amazing in every possible way. The wait staff is knowledgeable and extremely helpful, the food is DELICIOUS and with a full service bar even if the food takes some time (which in my experience it doesn't) you can enjoy some nice drinks.   Best of all? IT'S AFFORDABLE!!! Get five star food for two $$ prices...   Just go here, that is all.
73	0	Was excited to come to the Riv again since they announced t was being demolished.  Had such great memories here as a kid.  But WOW was it BAD!!  The only thing that was god was the parking.  Both myself and my daughter got ill after eating breakfast in the caf.  For 3 breakfast items it was over $50 with a tip and it was HORRIBLE!!!  Very sad to see this historic landmark go but employees have already checked out.  Stay away and go somewhere else.
1536	1	Five stars for serving breakfast 24/7.   Surprisingly hard to find a breakfast joint after 11 in Vegas of all places and Grand Lux was just what the doctor ordered. Our server, despite this being a pretty casual restaurant, was so good at his job, was fun, upbeat, and all the bells and whistles.   Aside from my husband's home cooked steak and jalapeo breakfast burritos, I think I had my second best breakfast ever. And my god, do they give you so much food! They gave me six sausage links in my standard breakfast, for example.  If you're waking up at 2 pm and looking for breakfast, head straight to Grand Lux. It was a wonderful surprise.
822	0	Not worth the price after having been to the Carnival World Buffet at the Rio Hotel & Casino.  This buffet was (key word, "was") rated the #1 buffet in Vegas but since the rating, there have been a whole group of buffets that have outdone this place.  This restaurant is mediocre at best.  Also, service is very spotty.  Once you go Carnival World Buffet, you don't go back!
188	0	the wait was long. ordered the lobster omelette and crabcake something. wow, don't even remember, that's not a good sign. I'm particular about my crabcakes. Not too much bread crumbs, that's good, but the crab was all shredded. I'm looking for lumps! Had a mimosa, that they forgot. I don't think i need to go back ;/
1500	1	I went here for my last meal in Las Vegas and I was impressed! I had the Big Breakfast which comes with 2 eggs, enormous container pilled high of  frites (fries), brioche toast, 2 sausage links, tons of bacon, orange juice and  coffee or tea. It was more food than I could ever imagine!   The best part was the strawberry croissant that came first before the breakfast.  I have never had this good of croissant besides Paris.  It came split in half with the strawberries baked inside topped with cinnamon and  a studel like topping almost like a coffee cake!  I believe they baked it like that split in half!  It was AMAZING!!!! I had died and gone to heaven! It was so flakey and good! I could only eat half and based around for others to enjoy.  I did the same with the huge helping of bacon and massive container filled with fries!  Everything tasted perfect and was the best breakfast I had in a long time.  This meal was not cheap at $21.95 but was worth it! Service was pretty quick overall and decor was really nice and decorated cute.    If was a fab last meal for Vegas and we took off for the airport.
1687	1	This location is really convenient if you're done with class and want to settle for some good food and cheap beers. This is also located near the Kiss mini putt putt if you're trying to take someone on a cheap date.   I definitely receive my money's worth here, especially for it being a non AYCE Korean BBQ restaurant. The service is fast and friendly. The food is consistently delicious and you really can't beat the happy hour deals. I actually spent less money here for two people than if we were to go to any other AYCE. The pork belly and bulgolgi are really tender and even with a slight char from the grill, they never got overcooked.
565	1	BEST THAI FOOD IN LAS VEGAS! This place is seriously amazing. It's off the beaten path in a pretty suspicious plaza. This place is always busy, we got there ten minutes before they opened on a Sunday for dinner and there was at least twenty people in line. It's totally worth any wait though. They have an impressive wine selection (a lot of rieslings) and everything on their menu is great. I always go with the Pineapple fried rice, spice level 8. It's so flavorful and the pineapple adds the appropriate amount of sweetness to offset the spiciness. A great appetizer is the crispy rice or the garlic wings. Seriously, you need to get the wings. The fried garlic is mouthwatering and the wings are so crispy. It's totally worth the trek over, if you're in Las Vegas and don't eat here you're making a mistake.
800	0	On our recent trip to Vegas, my mother and I came here because of a rave review by some people we met on the trip. My mom wanted Chinese and I wanted Mexican, so the restaurant seemed perfect.  The prices were shocking ($5 per taco? seriously?) so we ended up sharing the chips & salsa, Mongolian beef, and 20 vegetable fried rice. The food was delicious, but the prices are outrageous. It was $32 for the beef (which was basically a glorified salad). It was a delicious strip steak, but tiny, we were expecting more. The fried rice was delicious but not worth $20. Plus, the amount of food we were given did not satisfy us. When we arrived my mother was starving, and she left unsatisfied so we ended up having a second (tiny) dinner at Serendipity 3. Next time I want Mexican in Vegas, I'll go to Yolos in Planet Hollywood.
1565	1	Chef's burger?  Delicious. Sweet potato fries with cinnamon honey something?  Sweet 'n tasty. Deep fried mac & cheese?  The undergrad in me was drooling. Hazelnut nutella milkshake?  I will take 8 lactaids because you cannot keep me away from it!  I haven't had a milkshake in ages (stupid lactose intolerance).  But this was worth popping one of those chalky white pills every few sips.  I am looking up the address in San Francisco because I am not waiting until the next time I'm in Vegas for the sweet or savory goodness that is Burger Bar.  I hear there's one in St. Louis too.  (Oh, and I have a little crush on Hubert Keller.  Shhhh - don't tell.)
744	1	One of the greatest dining experiences I've had all year, maybe all life. Burger was succulent, excellent roll, each bite was juicy and delicious. The Oreo Milkshake had some amazing aftertastes, and the entire experience from onion rings to fried pickles was a heavy one.  I went into a food coma afterwards for about 1/2 a day.  We ate at 4 p.m., and I was done for the rest of the day!  Highly, highly recommended.
1631	0	first time here was a year ago. went with 2 of my friends, and we ended up going to their walk-up counter because the wait for an inside table was about an hour. we ordered small frozen hot chocolate.   i must say - i wasnt really impressed. it tasted like a chocolate shake with sprinkles. maybe its better if you go inside to order it? i dont know...  second time i met some friends in town. they were eating dinner (i didnt eat because i just ate). everything looked really good and portions were pretty decent as well.   third time we went in was a few weeks ago with my sister and some friends back home. ordered a frozen hot chocolate and a frozen white hot chocolate. i couldnt remember how big they were or how "eh" they were, but my sisters never been and we were already there. my sister ordered the frozen hot chocolate for two because her and her boyfriend were gonna share it. and it was waaaaaaaaaaay too much frozen hot chocolate! and as rich as it is, you really dont need anymore than a small.   service was alright - the cashier there was a little slow at ringing in orders/putting the tickets up on the rail. and it seemed they were short staffed or something because the girl making the drinks seemed overwhelmed the whole time we were there. agian, maybe the hype was built up so much i expected a lot?  maybe i'll come back, stick out the wait and eat inside?
735	0	If you want to be squished by hundreds of sweaty strangers with out even room to dance then come here. The restaurant is nice and I like the atmosphere the club has but Tao needs to seriously crowd control they let too many people in too fast, I was over it after 30 min. Not to mention the quality of people we ran into, maybe it was just random but this fat drunk Mexican literally feel on top of my girlfriend. My GF playfully smacked her ass when she got up. Apparently she didn't like that and started charging at my GF then tried to swing at her. Held back by all of her friends she finally stoped acting dumb and went away. I latter saw the same girl trying to dance on the stage where the bouncer kicked her off for being to raunchy. Thursday night might be better but I won't be going back. I've heard marquee and XS are much better clubs.
1050	1	If you come to Vegas, you gotta come to this place for brunch after a long night out on the town.  It is just so goddamn cool, it is ridiculous.  This is a restaurant that looks like a strip club on the inside.  Neon pink and blue lights everywhere and a lounge that makes you feel like you are in the heart of Dirty Vegas.  Fireside Lounge looks absolutely incredible.  I will be back!  I had a simple breakfast platter which was extremely filling and the portions were generous.  Having a separate cocktail waitress come around and offer you alcohol at 10 am was interesting too.  Not bad at all.  I will be making it back here on future Vegas adventures.  No doubt.
1163	0	I was honestly so dissapointed when I ate there. I honestly do not know what everyone was fussing about how it's the greatest thing in the world.  Cons: The line was long, (as suspected since it's new) once you get inside, there's another line. I don't know if they still have long lines since people know it's not the best lol The burgers were tiny and had very little taste to them, which I assume it's how it is in where it came from. It was very expensive for what you got to be honest. It was not good at all, way way over price. Like In-n-Out is better lol The kitchen where you can see them cooking the burgers is very unsanitary looking. There were buns everywhere, chopped onions on the floor, not to mention their was pretty brown lol DO NOT WORRY IF YOU HAVEN'T GONE THERE, YOU'RE NOT MISSING ANYTHING.  Pros:...umm they have really good chicken rings?  Hope this helps. I honestly would recommend to go there just to taste it just so you can say you've had it but I honestly doubt that anyone is going to return. Unless you're a tourist and drunk at 4 in the morning.
1288	0	Last time I went there were choices for the cotton candy martini's.. This time the rude bartender snapped at me and said NO, there isn't. My friend and I ordered a cotton candy martini regardless. He kept saying he was busy and would attend to our order soon. I told him to take his time and he snapped and said NO I WON'T... umm ok, I was just trying to be nice and not pressure the guy.   4 drinks and crappy service later, we paid and the bartender approached my friend when she paid and said "Sorry for the lousy service". Really? Admitting to the lousy service but not doing anything to improve it. Thumbs down. I'm seriously disappointed. I won't be returning. The Sugar factory's goblets made up for the bad service and not so great drinks.   I'm disappointed :(   OH and it was my birthday.
448	0	Don't get the food.. It's a rip off! I went to the outside window because I didn't feel like waiting for the restaurant. We got sliders.. they were whatever.. overpriced.  I only wanted to go to try the famous hot chocolate. It was good..Nothing amazing, honestly. I really think Dunkin's is comparable. Had to do it to say I did it!
275	0	Being in Miami there are a lot of hot dog places which load up your hotdog with tons of yummy goodness stuff (try the green or pineapple sauce).  So I am used to eating a loaded hot dog...if you can, try it with quail egg.  This place? Why go when you have amazing restaurants all around you.  I get that its a cheaper alternative to the $40 plates around you.  But there is a reason why the hot dog costs $8.  If you are going to go cheaper, maybe just hit up the McDonalds thats located on the same strip.  Its not that this place is terrible or anything.  Its just not great.  So why waste your money or your calories?  The staff is nice and the place feels clean so that is a plus.  You can sit outside and people watch.
1531	1	I was so excited to eat at Gordon Ramsay BurGR, and his name did not disappoint! Amazing, delicious, juicy and innovative shakes, appetizers and desserts. The star of the show are the amazing burgers!  Chanterelle mushroom burger - so delicious and exceeded my expectations! The meat was tender and juicy, and was topped with perfectly cooked chanterelle mushrooms and arugula. The bun was soft and melt in my mouth, just the way I like it.   Honey-pig bao buns - I loved the juicy pork belly and the crunchy cucumber, radish and cilantro. The honey-hoisin sauce was sweet and went perfectly to complete the experience of this amazing appetizer.  Truffle-Parmesan Fries - Delicious truffle and cheesy goodness on each fry. Served with a luscious truffle aioli. Huge portion, one order can definitely be split by two people.   The restaurant is located at a prime location in Planet Hollywood. The flames at the exterior of the entrance is phenomenal and hard to miss. The decor is awesome and futuristic with the cool lights and fun interactive menu at the entrance.  Service is friendly and prompt. We arrived right before the restaurant opened and fortunately were seated right away.   Make sure to get their early if you want to be seated soon. There are no reservations, and often a wait at this popular burger joint.    Overall I really enjoyed Gordon Ramsay BurGR! Food is delicious and the experience is fun. Definitely worth stopping in here for amazing burger goodness while in Vegas.
1439	1	Fantastic start finish!  At first walking in you don't know what to except. The hallway to get there is cold and well... HIDDEN. The menu is short and sweet. The only downfall is it doesn't list toppings. But that detail is so minor compared to the rest of the experience. They have made to order pizzas for you to choose from. Or you can order an entire pie. My group picked the white pizza, combo, sausage and banana pepper and I picked the pepperoni and mushroom slices.  We ordered our drinks. The boys picked some beers and us girls went with wine, which was $6 for a large plastic cup filled. We were thrilled! Nowhere ever gives you that much wine for $6.. Let alone in Vegas. Our pizza took about 5 min to come out. And every pizza looked and smelled delicious  but then eating it was even more amazing then what my first two senses were showing me.   After we finished our slices we went back for one more slice of the white pizza. IT WAS THAT AMAZING!  I will be back to Vegas in 2 weeks. And will be back her for sure!!
1226	1	Highly recommend getting there before they open at 5:30pm. We got there at 5:15pm and sat in the car, then slowly a line of people started to form. We literally got a table when they open at 5:30pm. Service was amazingly quick and attentive. The food arrived within 5 to 10minutes. The price is on the higher end for Thai food- average about $15 to $30 for entree, but it's well worth it. The menu is very extensive and it's sorted by the region of Thailand.    The garlic prawn comes with 8 generous pieces and flash fried with garlic seasoning. It was delicious and the shrimp was crispy. The prawn was deshelled therefore consumption is very convenient.   The crispy duck with the noodle was one of my favorite. The duck was tasty with a crispy skin. The flat rice noodle was slightly pan fried and complimented the duck really well. Pretty much, it's  similar to the Chinese chow fun (pan fried rice noodle) atop with crispy duck.   The Thum ka noon was minced pork with jackfruit. We randomly ordered this and it was interesting. It would be really good if it's eaten with rice. Overall, the food was very well seasoned and I cant stop burping after the dinner. I will definitely come back and try different entree. I'm curious how good a simple pad thai or pad see ew would taste in here?
1394	1	This isn't your usual Korean BBQ place, no all-you-can-eat here.  But the portions are generous, the staff is courteous, and happy hour just makes everything better!  We happened to arrive during their happy hour, and we were greeted promptly.  Clean, classy atmosphere.  The music is a mix of top 40 and big Kpop hits.  Service is prompt and courteous.  Nothing really noteworthy up to this point.  Then the food arrives -- everything was well-seasoned and good quality.  The meat we ordered was never chewy, a welcome change from Tofu Hut.  Their prime kalbi was surprisingly marbled, definitely my top pick of the evening, followed by the green tea/mango cheesecake for dessert.  If you're looking for tapas-style Korean BBQ, Gangnam certainly makes the grade.
194	0	First off, this hotel is GHETTO!!! I came here to enjoy a juicy burger and check out hot skanks, this was the wrong place to go. The parking structure is insane! its so tiny and awkwardly designed, you can barley drive your car through it! consider yourself lucky if you happen to find parking. The elevators from the parking structure to the hotel/casino were semi-working. I got inside the death trap and it began to shake aggressively, stopped for a few seconds them shook again and proceeded to the main floor. Once inside the casino, it was filled with old white men, JUST men! and a few 60 something year old cocktail waitress'. I got to the restaurant, and to my surprise ALL the Hooters girls looked like something out of the Hills Have Eyes! the only hot waitress i spotted was like 7 months pregnant!.....ew. We ordered our food, 10 min go by....20 min go by....30 MINUTES go by.....ummm where the fuck is my burger? i asked my server what happened to our order, and she says "oh, umm you have to wait, the food always takes a long time" (we ordered a burger and a salad, nothing more!) after 40 minutes, i told her to cancel our order and close our beer tab. She says "ok, BYE" didn't even call a manager over or anything. VERY unprofessional.
1849	0	I've been coming here for many years when planet Hollywood was the Aladdin... it was amazing... sadly no more... its slowly been going downhill... I came here tonight with family who are visiting from overseas.. very disappointing... it'll be a long time before I return
237	0	My best friend from high schools little sister turned 21 recently so we all headed to vegas to some fun.  They all booked rooms here based on the pool, so I went on hotwire and booked a room for my boyfriend and myself.  While hotwire is all about not telling you what the hotel is they give you a map and its pretty easy to tell which hotel you will be in.  So that was all pretty easy.  I called them and specifically asked for a smoke free room with a king bed.  That was all pretty easy and nice.  Our room was in the West Wing, which is pretty reviled on yelp and I understand why.  While nothing was super bad about our stay, some things made it not a place I would pay to stay in again: -the valet, there are like 5 entrances to the MGM by car, but only one of them takes you to the valet. WTF -the west wing hallways are seriously dark and kinda skeevy looking -no mini fridges in the room -horrible cable, they have like 7 channels and 5 of them not in english -security came and scolded my friend for leaving the door to her room open while we were in it -the rooms have absolutely no sound proofing at all. you can hear everything in the hallway and in the rooms next to you.   -$15 a day for wifi.   -no robes -i tried to move the side table closer to the bed and it was super sticky, since we had just gotten there, that was pretty gross  MGM is supposed to be nice, but they obviously put all the people who purchase rooms on the internet in lame rooms with absolutely no amenities.  If I were to ever stay here again I would have to make sure it would not be in one of these rooms.
197	1	Absolutely amazing! The place was busy but we were still seated right away. We didn't have to wait at all for our food. Our banana nut muffins were so fresh they were still warm. We all got different things off of the menu and liked everything we had. Lisa was our waitress- she was very friendly, and very efficient.  We will definitely stop here again when we visit vegas!
1698	1	Absolutely incredible. Came here on a Wednesday night with my husband and had a phenomenal experience. We got there 30 minutes before our reservation time but they had no issues seating us.  SERVICE: Amazing. Our waiter was so knowledgable and he was perfectly attentive -- not too scarce and not too annoying. The steak presentation is amazing. Love it.  FOOD: First is the bread. It might as well be an appetizer -- they have a lemon rosemary bread, some bread with bacon, a walnut bread, etc and it's such a unique selection that you can't help but eat them all. For appetizer we ordered the 1/2 Dozen Oysters and they were so fresh and delicious. For dinner I ordered the Kobe Filet, hubby ordered the Signature Beef Wellington with a side of Bone Marrow and Fingerling Potatoes. Every single bite of every single entree was amazing. I very rarely am able to finish an entree but I polished off my 8 oz Filet which was so wonderfully tender and seasoned perfectly. My husbands Beef Wellington was perfectly balanced with the meat and pastry and cooked a perfect medium rare. The Bone Marrow was melt-in-your-mouth with great flavor. The Fingerling Potatoes were so good and I loved that you could taste both the parmesan and the truffle! I only wish we had saved room for dessert!  Will definitely be back!!
1715	1	a must pit stop for true burger lovers! i heart the food here so much that i would marry the patty if i could. hands down the best because its reasonably priced, the burger dances in your mouth, and you leave with a huge smile. you can the reg burger for about $13 and if you hit the jackpot in vegas and want to splurge, go for the truffle burger, mmmm! my friends and i make sure we visit this spot each time we are in vegas.   for large groups, reservations are recommended. it's BUSY in there! just thinking of this place makes me hungry.
913	1	Seriously the best burgers I have ever eaten. My friends and I go to Vegas several times a year and we always go to Bachi Burger several times each trip. You have to try the Kalbi burger and the truffle fries. The sodas are great too. Don't hesitate to try something new because EVERYTHING is so good there.
1362	0	Okay. I am a huge buffet connoisseur. Right now I am sitting here just finishing my TI buffet .  Paid $19 for each for lunch.  Only thing I can say is stay away.  Prepared foods were dry, selections limited, no carving station, and desserts were minimalistic. I used to love Treasure Island, unfortunately I am so depressed on the quality of the whole hotel as a whole.
1165	0	Food tasted ok. Nothing special. The menu had maybe 10 items on it. Service was ok. Highlight was the lady making the balloon hats. She was amazing. Kids meals were almost $9 and nothing exciting. Atmosphere was dead. The Senor Frogs we've previously been to were amazing. This one sucked. Wouldn't recommend or go back.
1258	0	worst Brazilian food ive ever had!! majority of meat was dry, hard, flavor less and BURNT. not charred, but burnt!!! for the price of this place i expected better food. servers were polite, but some meat cutters/servers are rude and seemingly arrogant. I went here for a prebirthday celebration and it was definitely a disappointment. Only reason for 2 stars is the salmon because it was delicious
1112	1	Just a dinner here. Service is great - bunch of people run by our table. Food was good. Portions are not as big as in the Thai St Cafe. $11 a meal. Would've put 4 stars but it fascinates me how this place grew from a whole in the wall to such a big place. Is it all because of celebrities?
361	1	Great Pizza. Great concept. For a hotel that builds its brand off of opulence and grandiosity. Its good to know that the Cosmopolitan isn't without a sense of humor or irony.  To find the joint,  just go down the out of place white tile hallway with crappy florescent lighting, you'll arrive in a room the size of a shoebox serving some of the best pizza I've had in recent memory.   Great food, great concept. Well done Cosmopolitan. It looks like management has a few risk takers.
517	0	WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!! This place got me hella sick!  A whole day in Vegas ruined!!!   Never eat the chili!!! Right after I ate the hotdog, my stomach was killing me.  I had the runs and I threw up. A whole night in Vegas spent lying in bed sick because of this.
178	1	We love burgers! Saw this restaurant on Triple D.   We came here twice when we were in Vegas and ordered the following:  Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries (sweet flavor and good amount of chili cheese!) Kiki Burger (filled with umami flavor!) Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries (just like the name and tasted great!)  If you love burgers, and want to eat something different, get away from the strip and drive to Bachi! You will not be disappointed!
791	1	Found another bomb breakfast place in Vegas!! this place is on the Zagat list so that's why it gets a lot of ppl there every morning!! we ordered the steak benedict n the corned beef. Let me tell u this... the steak benedict was sooo good lots of steak in it so I was really full after! but the corned beef was even better!! My gf ordered that one wanna swtich with her hahah kinda far from the strip but its worth the drive tho!!
1185	1	Everyone has to eat here at least once in their life!  Let's go straight to the point:  - MORE THAN ENOUGH portions and FULL of flavour - Excellent service: prompt, polite, and accommodating  - Clean inside and outside of restaurant  American classics with a twist. They're a bit pricey but it's so worth it! There's also a 24/7 location inside The Quad to satisfy your late-night munchies. The top item in the menu is the 'Sage Fried Chicken Benedict' and is highly recommended for you first-timers and the hollandaise sauce is the star of the dish. A good place to bring a date and pig out, feed each other, or share one item since the portions are huge.   COME HERE.
1371	1	As much as I love In-N-Out, I have to admit that Shake Shack is better all around. The fries, the hamburger meat, the cheese, the frozen custard shake are made of quality ingredients and deserve recognition. Price point is higher for that very reason. I'm so addicted to the perfect fries! Cheese lovers can order a side of cheese dip to keep the fries crisp. The shackburger left me wanting more. I can't wait to try the shroomburger and the shackstack and their hot dog offerings. Please come to Los Angeles!
1764	1	Pretty solid burgers, salads, shakes, fries and cocktails. Had food here a few times while staying at Cosmo. Best cocktails, I tried a few places and nothing was as good.  Lobster Mac and cheese had a lot of lobster meat but was a little too heavy for me. I'll eat here again when I'm back
1847	1	Thomas Keller can do no wrong.  Everything I tried for brunch was uhhhmazing! It is located on the 10th floor of the Venezia tower so you get a mini-view if you get a seat near the window.  The Croque Madame had the perfect salty bite.  You get a ham and cheese sandwich, toasted and buttered to perfect.  To top it off you get a sunny-side up egg. Calories-Smalories. You cannot skimp on this greatness.  Break into the yolk and ZOMG... sauce to moisten the sandwich and to mix in with the sauce that reminds me of hollandaise.  Comes with a side of fries but you can ask for potatoes or fruit.  The sandwich is somewhat heavy so the size is perfect for a brunch meal.  The Sourdough Waffle was also amazing.  You don't need to extra syrup or butter because the waffle is by itself sweet enough.  It is topped with pecans and apples so it feels like you are eating a pie instead of a waffle.  The sourdough flavor is light but only if you nibble the edges of the waffle that is not topped with the sauce.  Raspberry filled beignets were also a great appetizer.  The waffle was light and pretty crumbly.  The raspberry jam was not overly sweet so the sugar coating makes it a bit that isn't overpowering.  I loved the feel of this restaurant in addition to the service and the coffee.  Yes, the coffee.  I don't know what coffee they brew but it wasn't sour tasting and I kept wanting refills. A must try when you are in Vegas and looking for a superb brunch location.
1212	1	Arrived in Las Vegas from Los Angeles, got to our hotel and looked for a place to eat... They're the first one to pop up since our hotel is very close to this restaurant. Checked the reviews and decided right away to try the place... And guess what?! EXTREMELY SATISFIED!!! Especially that I am a big Korean Dish Lover!!! I enjoyed my Bulgogi Bibimbap! Really tasty! My family opted for some Bulgogi, Pork Belly and Brisket since they have a HAPPY HOUR SPECIAL!! This is such an awesome spot!! The meats are really tender and juicy! I loved the Pork Belly the most! The environment is really clean and the servers are really friendly and informative! They made sure that we know how the menu works. They also offer some Japanese dishes! But I recommend the Korean dishes more. The side dishes are also amazing, they are honestly to die for! I always go to Koreatown in LA and yes, it has the same quality as it is in KTown! Will definitely come back whenever I visit Las Vegas!!!
1480	1	This place is always on my to do list when in Vegas whether it's for lunch, snack or late night eats.  Not  quite a secret but it is pretty hidden with no signage.  It's located on the 3rd floor in the Cosmopolitan Hotel.  You'll see a very long hallway with pictures on the wall and if it's late, you will usually see a line out the door.    They sell pizza by the slice for about $5.00+ and also whole pies.   They have more pizzas than what's on display so just order what you want and they can also throw some toppings on.  But my fav is the white pizza.   After you pick your pizza, you pay and then put your slice in the oven so it's hot and crispy when you get it.    If there's a line, I would wait, the pizza is worth it!!!
1129	1	Coming from Ohio, we had no idea where to go for brunch until my brother suggested The Egg & I. The food was awesome! Oscar, our waiter gave us the best service possible! The other staff members were so nice as well. We waited, but not long considering it was Sunday morning! The banana nut muffin is delicious and the portions we received were huge! Great place to go if you're looking for a breakfast/lunch idea!
846	1	Best burger of my LIFE! I came for my birthday and we almost walked away when we saw the line. Turns out it moved fast and I was impressed with their technology. They send you a text when your table is ready so you can walk away and get a drink nearby and relax. After a short wait we were at our table. You could tell they thought about everything. The waitress was very informed about every item on the menu, even when the food was served they make sure to face every plate in the same exact position.   But let me get to the food. Prices extremely reasonable, especially considering this is a gourmet restaurant. All the choices were appetizing, I went with the Euro burger (truffle, goat cheese, arugula) and my boyfriend the boar. We had the truffle fries to share. Everything was as good as it gets. The meat was cooked just enough and juicy. Again I was so impressed at how well thought out everything was.   I cannot wait to return here!
1857	0	A stinker. You know, I'm having a hard time trusting people's review, especially when a user's average review rating is four to five stars for several hundred reviews. Does that mean the majority of buisnesses are winners? I guess I'm gullible.  Bayside Buffet is a prime example of why I shouldn't be so eager to try a place recommended by Yelpers. And yet, Im writing one, too! Double standards am fail.  Anyway, bitching aside, my lunch here was super meh. 20 dollars paid at the kiosk, then briskly seated facing away the window (wut?), and then hoarded to the buffet line on both sides of the room. Immediately, I had a nagging feeling the experience would be super meh. How? Oh, let's see...the buffet selection is hella small! My college cafeteria offered more food than this -- and at better quality!   So what did I get?  Meats, a few starches, but mainly stuff jammed with protein.  Lambchops: Ugh. Below super meh. The lamb was gamey and foul tasting, an instant spit-out-of-the-mouth-and-eat-somethingelse-to-purge-the-mouth type thang. Minus points. Pork ribs: Wow, surprisingly soft, but lacked flavor. This was the best entree at the buffet. Turkey: Eh, thanksgiving turkey cut in your choice of dark or white meat. The carver was very nice, but the meat quality was very poor. Braised beef: This better be soft, or else I'm leaving! Fortunately for me, the beef was soft, though a weird aftertaste soured my mouth. Flank steak: Worst meat. I couldn't get steak down my mouth, because the texture was way too chewy. TOO CHEWY. Inedible. Even beef jerky is softer than this flank steak. Mash potatoes: Wait, yelpers, you like this crap? Buttery? Yummy? Uh... I give up.   Dessert Forget the banana pudding, the fruit pudding, the cakes, the brownies; the best dessert is the frozen yogurt. YES. Better than McDonalds frozen yogurt, the barometer for tasty, creamy, consistent goodness. The vanilla custard yogurt was by far the best part of the meal...  ...and the saddest part of the experience. Deserts over meats and entrees? Bayside Buffet, you fail.   And, oh, your service sucks.
965	0	Ha!, someone beat me to "'More' should be called 'Less'", and it's no better a name than the previous "Pharoah's Pheces".  Starving farm cats would walk away from the fish-labeled material that could be used to keep cotton sweaters safe from moths.  The prime rib could be used for knock-off Hong Kong Coach purses or for a lower-quality line of leather products it was so tough and dry.  Luxor at least could start a line of Egyptian-themed dog rawhide chews with the "prime rib" from "More-bid".  The morbid, morose "More" chicken legs were not quite as moist as the turkey Chevy Chase cut into for Christmas Vacation.  If you didn't know drosophila melanogaster was the scientific name for fruit flies you will become an expert entomologist on the little suckers at the morbid, morose "More".  Those aren't black sesame seeds on your dessert.  Opt-in and consume the comparably yummy & authentic African dung beetles and opt-out for eating "More".  Yes, I did notify the Filipina waitress my wife was chatting with in Tagalog of the issues and they were not new.
922	1	I absolutely LOVE this place! I wish i made billions of dollars when I went to Vegas so I could pig out here all day everyday!  First off the service is wonderful! Everyone was so friendly and all smiles! They are also very helpful in explaining the menu and pointing out favorites.   Bread: so delicious! If only I had 10 stomachs, I would have kept asking for more! It was soft and warm and there was a whole bunch of different ones. And that butter!! It was so creamy, I almost wanted to put the whole butter one only one slice of bread, but I had to share :p  Kurobuta Pork Belly: delicious!  The meat was very juicy. The cheesy grits was awesome and it went really well together.  Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras: it was my first time trying foie gras and I fell in love(Please don't send me hate mail animal lovers, i really didn't mean for it to be this way). The herbed goat cheese pop overs weren't for me, but if you like goat cheese you would love this.   Mac and cheese: very creamy. I usually don't like blue cheese in anything, but it was really good. Couldn't eat too much of it because it was filling.  Demi bone marrow: please order with your steak you wouldn't regret!  American eye wrapped with Mangalista pork: most juiciest and greatest piece of steak I have ever had. I also had a piece of seared foie gras to go with it! The foie and the steak goes so well together. When I eat the foie with the steak, it was like eating a piece of butter with steak and you know butter is life! Haha I feel like all the other steaks I've ever had in my life was a joke!   Overall, this place had made me one snobby steak eater. Steak back at home just ain't the same.
1660	1	I first discovered Shake Shack via The Message is Medium Rare. Being well over 2500 miles from the nearest location was heartbreaking. When I discovered there was not only one in Vegas, but one in NYNY, where I was staying, was a dream come true.  I ate here all three days of our trip. I had three different burgers. I fell in love.  The Smokeshack was my least favorite of the burgers. Bacon always feels like an unwanted after thought on burgers and even though they tried to balance it with acidic peppers it was still lack luster. The Shackburger is a perfect representation of a classic burger. The soft bun melts away, the burger has a crisp skin and tastes of steak, the toppings are in perfect harmony. The crown jewel of Shake Shack is the Shackmeister burger. Topped with their delicious fried shallots, cheese, and shack sauce. Perfection. Their Fries are deceiving, they look like crappy school lunch fries but they are crisp on the outside and pillowy soft inside. Cover them with cheese sauce because you are in Vegas!  They also serve beer here and no matter what we ordered we were always undercharged for the beer. I guess it was out lucky day.
927	1	Eating here for the first time today and I love it! I go to school at UNLV and I never knew this spot was so convenient, I'll definitely be visiting more often. We ordered the Gangnam meal today and the food was brought out very quickly and the workers are very attentive and clear about their variety of food items.
902	0	Background: As an avid leisure traveler and a seasoned business traveler, I spend about 100 nights a year in hotels all across the country. (75 % of those nights are booked on hotels.com)  I'm not tough to please when it comes to accommodations as I frequently stay in a wide range of hotel types, everything from Days Inn to Ritz Carlton, so this review inst bias in anyway.    Typically when I come to Vegas, which is at least once or twice a month, I stay at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino. I've recently decided to expand my horizons and begin trying out different hotels each time I visit. So I started with the MGM Grand.   Hotel: MGM Grand Hotel & Casino Location: Las Vegas, Nevada Dates: 3/25/15 - 3/27/2015 Room Type: Executive King Suite Room #: 20206 Room Rates: Night 1- $202.27       Night 2- $148.33 Hotel Fees: $64.96 Room Service/ Dining:$389 Gambling: $1100   This particular trip happened to be a 2 year anniversary getaway for my girlfriend and I. After the short but always dreaded drive from Southern California, we arrived at the MGM. We opted to self park in the garage where finding a parking space was a breeze (to be expected mid-week). We made our way from the garage to the Lobby. After a short 5 minute wait in line, we were beckoned to the Check-In desk. As I handed over my credit card and I.D. I inquired about paying for a room upgrade. The lady at the desk said they were sold out and no upgrades were available.. No big deal.  She then proceeded to make a call to check to see if our room was cleaned and ready. After a 20 minute long wait (not exaggerated) she was finally able to confirm our room was ready and checked us in. We made our way to the West Grand Tower and proceeded to the 20th floor where our room was located. As we approached our room, the door was ajar and housekeeping was STILL cleaning our room, even though the front desk confirmed that our room was ready.. We sat in the hallway and waited for another 20 min (still not exaggerated) while they cleaned our room. After 40 minutes, we were FINALLY able to get into our room. (Longest check-In process I've ever experienced).   The room was very well cleaned and in fairly good shape, This specific room appears to be renovated within the past 5 years.  Pros: Clean and Well Kept Large Windows/ Good Lighting Large Spacious Floor plan Automated Curtains/ Blackout Drapes Comfy Sectional Couch w/ Chaise Lounge Large Work Desk 360 degree rotating LCD TV for optimal viewing from entire room Refrigerator/ Mini Bar Dual Lighted Vanity Mirrors in Bathroom Large Dual Sinks in Bathroom Shower w/ Separate Tub Marble Tile Throughout Bathroom Full Length Mirror in Hallway  Recently Renovated  Cons: No Bathroom Ventilation/Fans No Deadbolt on door   As I'm writing this review I'm finding it hard to write a list of negatives about this hotel. If you are looking for a large no frills room/hotel for your Vegas getaway and base your experience on only the accommodations then this is the place for you.   Coming from a marketing background, I've always been a firm believer that customer service is they key to building customer/client loyalty. If people aren't satisfied with their service, they will go elsewhere.  With that being said, I cant say that I will return to the MGM in the future except to gamble or hit up Hakkasan but I would not recommend this hotel to my friends, family or colleagues simply due to the fact of the poor customer service that I experience during my stay.
572	1	I had the farm burger, great combination of creamy yolk and crispy duck great bacon over a medium well patty(my preference) and a side of truffle fries! The aioli is really delicious. They update their menu too. so the next time you check this restaurant, You may find a new burger on the menu
1294	0	Not sure what happened to this place. I ate here on my previous trip to Vegas in 2006 and the food was decent, but this time, the breakfast buffet was pretty bad. The eggs literally had water sitting in the bottom of the pan and were beyond mushy and some of the other food just didn't look appetizing. We ate here 2 mornings and one morning we got this humongous glass of OJ and the other morning we got a glass of OJ that was meant for a baby...pretty weird and trying to get our servers attention on the 2nd visit for refills was pretty impossible. The highlight of the buffet was the omelette station. You can pretty much customize what you want in it, and is made to order; the wait was only around 5 minutes for one. Honestly, the only reason we ate here 2 mornings was because we had coupons from staying at PH and it was cheaper than the cafe in the hotel. We were pretty selective on our tastings the 2nd trip though.
1549	0	Oh man... DON'T get me started with TAO night club. ARGH, so I came here with 5 girls total to TAO waiting for the rest of our bachelorette party.  2 of the girls parted ways after only 10 mins of being there and then there was 3. The 3 of us started drinking at the bar/restaurant area first before we went back up to the main club. Once in, it was PACKED... I mean you're lucky if there are tiny spots where you can BREATHE a little and have some room, but other than that, NO ROOM!  The main dance floor area WAS PACKED. SO PACKED that it was unbearable because you couldn't dance...   Bouncers there were rude and kept belly bumpin me thinking I was going to go under the velvet ropes to a table... which I wasn't ... argh all in all. I really don't like TAO NIGHT CLUB! I wished I was able to go to a better "EDM"-ish night club during my stay in Vegas, but I didn't have enough time to do that... Only upside was that Cash Cash was playing on the weekend of 7/26 so that was nice...   Other than that, I don't think I'll be returning to TAO!
587	1	I live in Henderson, so this review is from a local.  I looked up what time they opened so I could be first in line for a take out for our lunch order. Looked up the distance and time so as to arrive around 15 minutes early. So I'm standing there and a bmw pulls up and sits right there in front of the entrance and of course leaves their engine on to run the a/c as it's around 100F out. The fumes started to bug me so when I saw one of the employees I knocked on the glass door and asked to sit inside (even though they weren't open yet) and he immediately let me in around 10 minutes early! One star.  I sat and people started coming in before anyone was seated, and I didn't feel like standing just to be first. When they started seating, the guy said ok, who's first (second star) and I stood, walked past the other people and said I'd like to make a take out order.  I just got two cheeseburgers and an order of fries. He asked me if I wanted L / T / O (lettuce, tomatoes, onions) and I said yes, how would you like them cooked? One well done, one medium. I forgot to tell them to burn my fries - I like them really crunchy. Oh well, next time.  The order took around 15 minutes or so (third star). The fourth and fifth star was for the first bite of my bachi burger. The bun is thin, so you don't have to unhinge your jaw to get a full bite. The burger is just tasty and juicy and I got l / t / o with every bite. Fries were good (crunchy next time!). For the fries, I'm in love with their pineapple ketchup. And they marked one well done!  Location: right off the 215, a couple cross streets down Windmill.  Total was $24 with change.
908	1	Being that I stay at the Cosmo now (yes they won me over from Palazzo/Harrah's) I always make it a point to stop at this spot. Lunch or Dinner I think it beats all the high end restaraunts in the Cosmo...especially for the price. The Tapas joint has salty foods, the sushi joint is just ok, Comme Ca - I have yet to try. The cafe on the ground floor is good if you can beat the line.  Now DO NOT go here after the clubbing hours. Its madness, the pies get picked up almost immediately and it takes forever to get a couple slices because people just want something in there tummies to take the buzz off or kill the hangover that is going to come the next night.   GIven its next to Marquee - all the clubbers will hit this spot immediately after partying.  I have met the chef here, and he was real friendly as is most of the staff (Unless its post clubbing time - which is crunchtime for them)! I recommend the white cheese pizza and a simple Pepperoni. But if its late - good luck whatever comes out of the oven first is what you are going to get - but alas - the pies here are all good. I have tried 5 or 6 flavors and none have dissapointed me.   Here's a secret - if you are staying at the Cosmo you can order a whole Pizza and they will deliver it to your room. It takes about 45-1 hour but it beats waiting in line with the rest of the drunkies!
802	1	his place has redeemed itself.   I was lucky to be seated right away since I was there all alone. My waitress Amanda was there immediately to see if I had any questions and to take my drink order. She has a warm smile and made me feel very welcome. I ordered the Texas toast French toast with eggs and bacon. It was delicious. I also ordered a side of toast for which she asked if I wanted it buttered which usually they don't so that was great. The eggs were perfectly over medium and they were actually seasoned. Amanda was very attentive and was sure that I was not in need of anything. I also had the banana nut muffin it was one of the best I've had in a restaurant, I am a bit partial to my own.  I will say the service through out was exceptional from the moment I walked in until I left even thought the register had trouble reading the card I had.   The food would definitely be worth the wait, and the service I experienced was above expectations for how busy the are. Give it a try if you haven't been
260	1	This is it!  Michael Jackson isn't the only one.  This place is so great...every aspect of it.  What carne asada fries are to drunks in San Diego and what Paisano's Pizza is to drunks in Hermosa Beach, Grand Lux is to drunks in Vegas.    The beauty of this place though is that it is for classy drunks and not even for only drunks.  The food: perfection.  They have THE BEST Chicken Parm I've ever had. They use a number of different types of cheeses that add to the tastyness of it.  They also lighly bread the chicken making it more tasty.  Unlike other places where all you taste is fried batter.  You get the flakeyness and deliciousness of the breading here with the juicyness of the chicken.  Now let's move on to the next entree...shall we?  If you order Buffalo ______ at Grand Lux, it's a safe bet to be amazing.  Anything Buffalo is good here. Their buffalo chicken roll appetizers are some of the best appetizers I've ever had and their spicy buffalo chix sandwich just adds to the buffalo goodness.  Sometimes I order both and I may get a look from the waiter recognizing my buffalo filled meal, but all that subsides after the first bite.  Now to breakfast...  I tried their breakfast buffet here for the first time 2 weeks ago, and it was $15.95 and it included juice.  Very good breakfast selection of eggs, bacon, omelette station, fruit, waffles, etc.  The only thing missing was pancakes.  What i did though was made a nice dessert out of the waffles by taking some hot waffles and adding some of the chocolate chips they have laying around and put a nice dose of whip cream on top.  And if I'm feeling good, add some fruit.  They also have hash browns, which were some of the BEST hash browns I've ever had.  They weren't dry at all.  It was just great.  The greatest part is that they have 6 cheesecake factory cheesecakes (b/c it is the same company) and a whole bunch of other awesome desserts that I am sadly usually too full to eat.  I can't recommend this place more!
1906	0	Terrible nothing tasted right. Maybe I'm spoiled because I always eat at the buffet at the Wynn but this was disgusting. What a waste. Cold eggs stale waffles fatty bacon and ham. The only saving grace was  the omelette and even that was mediocre at best.
4	1	Our server  was breeaanda? She was super nice and helpful. We were  originally sat outside but someone in our party had a fear of birds so they were able to relocate us inside. Our server was attentive and help and friendly. Chili Omelet  was the best!!
783	1	What a fantastic place this is!!! I'm not just saying this as a HUGE fan of Gordon Ramsay, but I'm saying this as a burger monster!! My husband and I woke up after a late night in vegas, just to go stand in line to get a taste of Burgr and it was worth all of it!!! We started off with the roasted jalapeno poppers, which were served in individual little shot glasses with the sauce at the bottom. They were delicious. Definitely one of the best I've tasted. My husband ordered a cocktail, while I decided to go with the Shakes - Shake #1 which was a chocolate shake with caramel pudding (yes pudding!)... We ordered the uber cheese burger and the southern yardbird burger with a side of truffle parmesan fries. The burgers were cooked to perfection. The staff was friendly, efficient and helpful. All in all a five star experience and I will definitely go back there!
1154	1	This places is fantastic!!  Erin was our server for b'fast last Saturday and she was great!  Good prices, great food and very friendly.  We went twice over a 2 week tour of NV and CA. Would highly recommend going here to get away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip!
570	0	The concept of this place is crazy.  It's also bordering on criminal to charge $4 and up per taco regardless of how good the ingredients are.  The Chinese food well let's just put that aside.   The tacos are pretty good but seriously these prices are absurd even by Vegas standards especially the portion size.  I can get tacos in many places in LA or OC for $1.25 that are many times superior (2 Guys, Taco Leo).  Taking aside these huge issues the tacos are good but not as authentic - I don't care how many abuelas you have making toritllas in the front of the house.  The Chinese food is like a more authentic version of PF Chang but dim sum style.  Again the food is tasty but about 3x in price of much better stuff I can get in dozens of places in SGV.   The Bazaar is great this place is just weird and expensive.
650	0	First of all, I and most of the people reviewing this place wrote this review to receive a free dessert for mentioning my server's name - Jorge. The food here is really not worth the price. The meat is hardly seasoned and the selection is terrible. One of their "12 cuts of meat" offered is pineapple. You would be better off just going to Texas de Brazil for better food for a better price. Also don't waste your money on all you can eat shrimp, it was served room temp with shell on and like most of the stuff here tasted like nothing.   Final note ; the free dessert looked nothing like the other desserts they had around the place, it ended up being a dry brownie with some chocolate icing on top.
141	1	The Egg & I has got to be the best breakfast dining experience I've had in Vegas. The place is busy because the food is excellent for a really good price and the service is very good.  Food: 1) Banana Nut Muffin was the best I've ever tried so far. You could tell they used a lot of butter because it was so soft and flavorful! 2) Benedict - The eggs were poached perfectly and the hollandaise sauce was amazing. Perfect execution of this dish. 3) Ranch potatoes were FANTASTIC. They were seasoned perfectly and not overly salty. They didn't have that heavy, thick potato texture. It was lightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Service: The hostesses knew how to handle the influx of people waiting and the servers were friendly, helpful, and very efficient. We even got water refills without even having to ask.
772	1	Peppermill ended up being the place that most surprised me in Vegas, I wasn't really sure what to expect but now I recommend this place to anyone I talk to who is planning a trip to Vegas.   We came during the afternoon brunch so my I don't have anything to say about the Fireside Lounge [except that I really want to try it out next time].   We came at a pretty random time, like 2 pm or something on a weekday and were quickly sat. The best way I can describe the interior is that it is like an old fashioned diner with a modern twist, it is colored blue, pink and purple! One thing I noticed is that it seemed well maintained and clean, unlike many old school diners and other places on the strip.   Service was prompt and friendly, checked on us the right amount of times while also letting us pig out in peace.   There were many many things I wanted to try on the menu but I opted for an omelet, it hit the spot and was a TON of tasty food. I definitely recommend this place for food after you have been walking the strip all day and have worked up an appetite. The price was more than reasonable for the amount of food you get and we all left stuffed and happy. We also left with a complimentary souvenir photo of our group - fun touch!   It is a fairly simple looking place from the outside during the day which could make it easy to miss, it is up on the northern part of the strip sorta near Circus Circus.   If you are looking for an affordable place to stuff your face in Vegas - definitely try the Peppermill!
1583	0	The location of this hotel is great, for the price, it was close to everything we wanted to do. However, the hotel is in a sad state of disrepair. The beds are uncomfortable and we paid over $20 a day resort fee to look out the window at a disgusting almost empty  mildew pool being renovated. All of the horrible pictures are correct. The elevators are terrifying, and one even closed when we came back from lunch. The casino is small and feels like a frat house, and the staff look bored and uninterested , but they are nice. You don't get lost here though and aren't a 30 minute walk from the room in the hotel. Which is nice. The rooms are relatively clean but don't expect anything  to work properly. The televisions are old tube tvs and are probably 15 years old but whatever. The food at Hooters was not great but the waitresses were ok. Don't expect anything and you won't be disappointed.
1995	1	Food: Food here was great! I had a burger with chili and skinny fries. The chili was not bad, the burger was so tasty, and the fries were great!  Price: Prices here were cheap. There was this really expensive burger on the menu which my group was checking out but most other items were $15 and under.  Service: We were seated immediately and service was not bad.  Atmosphere: Not a super casual place, kind of reminded me of a Red Robin or something.  There also was a bar located directly behind our table. There were also tvs in some of the booths.  Location: Located in Mandalay Bay near Urban Outfitters upstairs.
1255	1	LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! Thomas Keller, you are amazing. This is a MUST try brunch place in Vegas; I will take this quality food over 3+ hours of waiting for a buffet anyday. And this being my second Thomas Keller experience, and just as good as the first (Fleur de Lys, San Francisco), I am determined to try every Thomas Keller restaurant possible in my lifetime.  We had a 10-15 minute wait on a Saturday morning Christmas, but it was nice because we lounged around and looked at their menu beforehand. We did have a service problem. But I still gave them 5 stars for the way they remedied it. They brought out one of our orders before the other... WAY before. I think we waited a good 15 minutes for our present order to get cold before the other one came out. However, like all top-notch French restaurants, impeccable service rendered the mistake to practically nothing. The service:  - waiter apologized many times - brought out assorted fruit plated in a cup by the chef - offered us drinks from the bar on the house - the restaurant manager herself brought out the dish and apologized - the dish was put on the house, cutting our bill in half  Service, service, service. They are AHHHMAZING, polite, speedy, attentive, and friendly. Except for that period of time where our waiter was a bit MIA, everything else was flawless.  I was a bit skeptical about their chicken and waffle, because... chicken and waffles? Thomas Keller? Most popular item on the menu? ...uhh, come again?  I was very happily proven wrong when we ordered it anyways. Chicken is usually too dry and waffles are usually too sweet. This chicken... I don't think I've tasted chicken so flavorful WITHOUT the gravy or waffles so flawlessly textured and flavored... add some of their gravy to your chicken, and some butter and syrup to your waffles... I could die eating this for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day for the next year.  I got the crab special... I forgot what it was called, but it was a weekend special of crab, macaroni, and cheese, baked and topped with scrambled eggs and black truffle hollandaise sauce (black truffle anything, HOLLA!). I ate every bite even when I was stuffed up to my esophagus because it was that good.  Get their orange juice, by the way. Super fresh and a perfect balance of flavor to your meal. Judging by the flavor of the orange juice, I'd assume their mimosas to be great as well.  Ambience was wonderful. This restaurant is located near the Venetian hotel check in. You take a separate elevator up to a different, more secluded lobby by the pool, and the decor inside the restaurant is classic and has windows that look out to scenery.  Great service, nice ambience, and AMAZING food... I will most definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas.  Psst... check out Bouchon Bakery downstairs after your brunch and take something to go. You won't regret it!
1256	1	As vegetarians, we ADORE this place. Nearly everything on the menu can be made vegetarian or vegan even if it doesn't say so. Just ask your server!   We had our first date here and every year we return to re-enact that beautiful evening.   Our favorites:   Crispy Rice (vegetarian style) -- truly amazing flavor, we could eat this all night. It actually paired very well with the  Papaya Salad (vegetarian version) -- delicious! Our only disappointment this most recent visit is we asked for Medium spicy and it was completely mild.   Mangoes & Sticky Rice -- luscious perfection! Never disappoints. I've been experimenting with making my own but they really have it down. The crunchy fried mung beans on top are a crispy balance to the chewy rice and ripe mango, and I have no idea how to replicate those at home!   I understand there are some low reviews from tourists visiting Vegas who may have had an uneven experience and felt disappointed, but as residents of Vegas who have dined here many times as well as at all the other Thai offerings in town, this place is the deal. If you had a less than spectacular time, try again. It is so worth it!   And yes . . . the parking lot is a little sketchy sometimes, but this has no bearing on my tastebuds. Go with a friend!
1919	1	Let's go, let's go, let's go! Super fun, relaxed atmosphere- great place to stop by for a late lunch after an afternoon at the pools. Even better if you fit in a morning workout, because the food is even more glorious without the food-coma-associated-guilt.   Service: Attentive and very helpful  SPIKED SHAKES: Amazing. Can personally recommend Birthday Cake, Cereal Bowl, and Drunken Monkey. What's even more amazing is how good the vegan cinnamon pecan shake was.  You really can't go wrong with any of the burgers (and as far as the sides go, I'm usually a sweet potato fry fan, but their onion rings came out on top!). Our group also may have ordered a second round of the crispy pork belly buns to take home. I can't wait to go back and try a few more of the "nosh" items (small plates/apps)- poke tostadas or buffalo chicken dip, anyone?
53	0	I made the mistake of having such high expectations of China Poblano because they were just completely crushed.  I had heard so much about  culinary genius, Jose Andres and that is the reason I even went into the restaurant after perusing the menu.  If it was not associated with Jose Andres, I would have immediately done a 180 after seeing the $11.00 price tag on a serving a dim sum.    Jose Andres is known for his tapas servings and so our group ordered a number of tapas servings to share.  And they were just OK.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't mind blowing either.  If I am paying $8 for a mini mini pork sandwich- it BETTER blow my mind, and it did not.  My favorite dish was the eggplant dish, but it wasn't fabulous enough for me to return. I even tried eating the Chinese dish and Mexican dish, side by side to see if that would make a difference in the "experience", but it didn't.  In fact, I still don't get it.  It was not a fusion restaurant, but rather two menus in one.   The ambience is cool and trendy, but next time I am considering Mexican or Chinese, I will definitely go elsewhere, where the flavor satisfaction matches the price.  I can get ambience elsewhere.
600	1	Alright, let's talk Thai;  I could eat Thai food everyday, for every meal, I literally cannot get enough of Thai food into my pie hole. And I would gladly move to Thailand in a heartbeat if it weren't the sauna sweatbox of tropical equator hell, where  I'd look like a tool that had taken a shower in my clothes pretty much whenever I walked outside....  not pretty.  So as a consolation, I've been terribly fortunate to have the best Thai restaurant in the U.S. right in my own back yard, (well, ten miles away but whatever) within the first week of moving here, I had my first experience at Lotus of Siam and my world has never been the same since.    And what a surprise that here, in this archaic mish mash of tired trashy tourist sin reeking of cheap vodka and regret, there lies a culinary palace in the most unsavory of places, but a landmark nonetheless, (and ever since it's small cameo on Top Chef, the hoards of tourists have increased tenfold, making wait times to over an hour at peak times).  In a rundown shopping center east of the Strip, Chef Saipin creates some the loveliest, humble yet sophisticated dishes that make up for the lack of ambience.  Now please, please do not be disparaged by the desolate location and crappy shopping center facade; yes, it is dilapidated and no, your car will not get jacked (many a friend have periodically checked to see if their car's still there) no worries, the homeless keep an eye out for ya!  They've even told me I had a brake light out, which deserved a buck...good people, those cracky addicts...  As you enter through what I can only imagine is akin to walking through the entryway of a Western Union in Compton, you've suddenly matrixed into a crowded, tiny vestibule that is indicative of the original size of the restaurant.  In fact it's recently gone trough an expansion, and when you've managed to squeeze past the herd, the room on the right is the expansion, while directly in front of you is the original dining room.  And the interior, although updated, has the exact the same finishes: green carpeting dark, mahogany wood chair rails, brass railings and oddly scaled glass drop chandeliers....it's like a time machine into retro...without the chic... which I have grown to absolutely love, like visiting grandma's house in the not so nice neighborhood during the Holidays.  Apart from your typical Thai Apps, (Shrimp Toast, Stuffed Chicken Wings)  The Moo Dad Deaw is an awesome starter, akin to a Bar snack item, to be eaten with a nice cold beer.  These succulent, juicy, tender pieces of pork are the precursor to chicken fingers, you can easily pop these suckers one after one in your mouth; as a good accompaniment, have some Sticky Rice to go with it; go ahead wreck your diet, you weren't serious about those New Year's resolutions anyways...  My favorite curry dish on the menu, which isn't you normal curry dish:  the Braised Short Rib with Penang Curry - this luxurious dish has all the depth and richness laid into it's protein not usually paired with Thai cuisine but definitely makes sense.  The hearty Short Rib goes so well with Penang, which is so good, Chef Saipin add Cognac into the Curry which elevates it to whole different level.  I bypass all the other curries cuz I know this one has the best flavor profile out of all of them.  Lotus of Siam has made me a Pad See Ew snob, ever since that first time I ate here, the quality and technique that is executed here is so superb; I honestly have to remind myself that it's not supposed to be this good!  First, the Noodles have that perfect texture; mochi chewiness but firm enough to achieve maximum noodle satisfaction.  Combine it with the Egg, Beef, Broccoli and sweet Soy, it's such an addictive dish that's light yet savory with just a hint of Black Pepper to tighten the palate...just yum.  Another all time favorite of mine:  Crab Fried Rice.  The way that Lotus makes this dish is pretty unbelievable, the rice is incredibly fluffy with a light infusion of crab broth.  I love finding morsels of Crab and Egg as if it's a treasure hunt and there's always a big hunk of Tomato wedge that's seems so out of scale with everything else that's on the plate.  But, as I've ordered this dish consecutively on numerous occasions, it's become a endearing and integral component that adds acidity to an otherwise aromatic, subtle dish.  It is a must-get item on the menu, but be warned, it's not an all out powerhouse of strong flavors, so you may want to order it as an earlier course before the heavier dishes arrive to your table.   As dining experiences go, it's all over the place except for the food.  And in the end, with moderate prices, I can't really say that anything else affect the fact that Lotus has the best Thai food I've ever had.    Ratings (Out of Five Stars) Food:          5+++ Ambience:  2 (much improved hole in the wall) Service:       4.75 (they're always so busy, it can't be helped)
370	1	Perfection in every way. No, seriously.  We were seated quickly by a friendly hostess and greeted instantly by our waitress who was incredibly kind and checked on us often. I never needed to ask for any refills. SPEAKING OF WHICH, they give you a large container of coffee to help yourself. Amazing for beating that hangover. So is the food. Oh.... The food...  It's great and the menu is HUGE. I enjoyed a veggie omelet while my buddy had French toast stuffed with eggs and cheese. Told you you'd be beating that hangover. The home fries are top notch as well.  I love the table system of alerting the wait staff when you need something. There's a smily face at your table that you simply turn to the frowny side. What a good idea.  Needless to say, I loved it here. I now have a new breakfast spot for my Vegas weekends.
1788	0	$18 for the quality and flavor of a Grand Slam. Average breakfast plate price is $22. One of those places that looks busy and worthy because of the central location. Service was absolutely pathetic on a slow day. One of our friend's got his food wrong, the server made her way over 10 minutes later just to say, "I put it in right! It wasn't my fault!" How professional. Took 15 minutes to get greeted, 25 to put food in, and after meal, 20 minutes with dirty plates in front of us waiting for the check. The server grabbed our cards and continued to run food and greet other tables, taking another 15 minutes to return with our check. I am a server who was with a cook and a bartender. I can fairly say do not waste your money. Wait twice as long for a bang out breakfast at Hash House A Go Go.
1345	1	It can't be a trip to Vegas without grabbing a slice of pizza from the secret pizza place in the Cosmo hotel. Every slice is delicious down to the last bite. There's mainly standing room to eat your pizza but right outside there's plenty of seating in the hotel. You can see them making the pizza right as you walk in! It's a good place for a quick bite, they usually have a couple of different pizzas made where you can order by the slice, but don't fret, they also make whole pizzas for takeout.
785	1	I found it!  Best/worst idea ever was using my friends review for help, even though he gave an important clue, I was sent to the wrong floor, doh!   I ordered the white cheese pizza slice, and my  wife ordered the mushroom slice.  Delicious cheese with feta and garlic that melted in my mouth on every bite.  The mushrooms on my wife's slice were very fresh; she added red pepper and parmesan cheese to complete her pizza bliss.  Pizza is thin and pretty decent size; with the cost of 5 dollars a slice or 25 for a whole pie(16 slices), this eatery is a broke drunkards dream.  We will definitely  be back for a whole pie to take on the road home, or have for dinner if we lost our butt at the tables.    If you're in the Cosmopolitan casino leave there and go to the mall area.  From there go to the third floor and find a pool table.  You should see a hallway with vintage albums as wall art.  Follow it down, order and enjoy your victorious slice!
1495	0	Went there  with Party of 10. Service was good(Kevin) but that was the highlight. Trust me that there is no way this restaurant can be considered good. It is a tourist attraction but that is it. No one in our party of 10 thought the food was good.  I wouldn't normally write a bad review but I have a feeling that management knows the food is bad (how can't they?) but just don't care. They're making money regardless. I believe most place that have substandard food, try but just can't pull it off. Rustler's is probably pulling in the cash and just couldn't give a crap which is what their food tastes like.
1166	1	There are lots of great reviews on here so I will just confirm that it's amazing and that you must go. Get the croque madame!  The tips I have are that it's a bit hard to find, go to the check in area and take the elevator tucked in the corner to the right. Also, the doors to the pool area don't require a key card so it's a great space to lounge while waiting for your table. We went on a Sunday morning around 11am and only had to wait about 20 minutes, perfect experience.
1062	1	Me: Bites into the burger Me: 0.0 Me: (does best impersonation of Gordon Ramsay) this burger is #$(@* AMAZING!  So how does BurGR stack up against other popular burger joints in Vegas? Here is my definitive list:  1) BurGR 2) Bachi 3) Holstein ..... 100000) Burger Bar  First off, the decor here is awesome. Who doesn't love live flames everywhere, especially in the middle of PH. It's pretty much, Hell's Kitchen. ;). Onto the food! The Euro burger was a hogwash blend of aromatic truffle aioli and goat cheese. Every bite was packed with savory flavors. Additionally, the truffle fries here are darn amazing. Thick cut and fried into crispy golden slices of heaven. My gf and I agreed that the Euro burger was one of the best burgers we've ever had!  Overall, my only complaints were the snotty server and long wait time to be seated and fed (45 minutes). She was not very friendly and she gave us attitude when we tried to use our total rewards card... However, even questionable service still doesn't compare to the impeccable food. Furthermore, the long wait only made us savor the food more.   If this is the kitchen in Hell... and Gordon Ramsay is the lord of the underworld... I'm fine with trading my soul for this burger. XD.
910	0	Expensive and not very good! We were on the brink between brunch and dinner. Food was cold and had kind of gone dead. Seasonings were out of control. I got sick post and probably ate about 4$ worth of the 60$ we paid. They EMT's were carrying a guy out on a stretcher as we arrived! Should have smelled what the Rock was cooking right then! Oh well, Panda Express would have been a better choice!
835	1	I've been here several times and everything here is always perfect. From the wait service to the quality of the food. The butter here is simply amazing.   I ordered the Boudin Blanc while my husband ordered the chicken and waffler. My goodness, that is the juicest, perfectly seasoned roast chicken I think I've ever had in my life!!. I totally wasn't expecting it and I found myself eating off my husband's dish. The boudin blanc is tasty as well since I've had it before, it's a good dish to get over and over.   This time i ordered a side of Lyonnaise potatoes. Potatoes were good, but with all the other food I was eating already, i barely finished that.   I'm definitely a fan of Bouchon since this is my must stop brunch place whenever I am in Vegas. Next time I really want to try the beignets!!
505	1	Wanted a special dinner with my beautiful BAE so I made reservations on Open Table. After watching Frozen Fury (LA Kings destroyed the Colorado Avalanche) we took a Uber to the Paris Hotel.  Our table was located upstairs. We had Matthew and Tony for our waiters. Our appetizers were the Gnocchi, Sriracha Roasted Broccoli and the Mac & Cheese. All three were delicious. As you can imagine the presentations were top notch.  Our main entrees were the 8 oz. Filet for me and the American Rib Cap for her. Amazing pieces of beef.   This was my first visit to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. I love his shows (Master Chef, Hell's Kitchen, Kitchen Nightmares) and now I can save I love his food. Can't wait to visit another one of his establishments.
1311	1	First time having a Croque Madame so don't have anything to compare it too but it was delicious! The bread used is so dang tasty!  Also, they forgot to bring us bread so we dipped the fries in the jelly they brought us and it was a very delicious combo- sweet and salty. Mmmm  The Brioche was a little too rich and sweet for our taste but it didn't prevent us from cleaning our plates :)

You get two yard drinks in a souvenier plastic container for $40! You can find way better deals at any bar in Vegas. The food is so overpriced it's not even funny. Something like $20 for a quesadilla. If you like overy loud music and a party atomosphere and you don't care how much lousy quality food costs then you might like this place. Otherwise, I'd never go back.
1707	1	Who would've thought that foul mouthed, temper flaring, firecracker of a chef Gordon Ramsay could pull off such a MEOWWWW of a restaurant?!   I dig it. I dig it a lot.  You'll fit right in with that super short, tight black dress and sky high heels. The in-your-face, very sexy red throughout the restaurant grabs your attention as soon as you walk in. Up the coolness factor by ordering cocktails on an ipad and then have a hard time choosing what to eat because everything LOOKS. SO. GOOD.  And because we're in Vegas, it's just fitting to have a steak cart presentation tableside. Drool over every cut of MMMeat available from steaks to Wagyu to chops. (drool over the sexy patrons as well!)  The bone-in ribeye is marvelous, darling! simply melt in your mouth. Of course, being the foie gras lover that I am, I ordered this as a topper for my steak with bone marrow sauce. (I'M GOING ALL IN!) The grilled asparagus and mashed potatoes are excellent sides. The bread basket? don't be a fool to skip it.   Sleek and stylish design with a high-energy vibe, phenomenal service and oh la la EVERYTHING?   Gordon Ramsay, you've got one helluva restaurant.
415	1	Every trip to Vegas, it is a MUST for us to stop here and eat! This place is AMAZING, everything on the menu is worth trying....  Now, the service.... if I could offer Carol Anne 20 stars, I WOULD! She is super sweet, always with a smile. We are a large family....11 of us!!! Some waiters/waitresses don't like or fear a large crowd...but she took us all with the biggest smile ever!!!!  it's service like that, that makes this delicious experience....PERFECT!!!
1477	1	My wife and I visted Vegas for a week long vacation and about half way through we were craving a good down home breakfast. Once we found and ate at The Egg and I, our craving was no more. We loved it so much we went back a couple of days later. The food was great and the service was just as good. If and when we return to Vegas, The Egg and I will be our place for breakfast.
1437	0	This place it just O.K.  There was a wait to get in and when we got seated we got the high bar stool chairs and after an hour my feet fell asleep.    The service was TERRIBLE.  The waitress was difficult to find.  My boyfriend never had his drink refilled.  The food was below average but the prices were NOT.  I had a super huge Margarita that was great though and that was the only redeeming thing about the place.  Still it has a good location on the strip...but if you are looking for quality food...keep walking.
1327	0	I am a cheap bastard sometimes, and my brother is as well so when we saw just off the strip for less than $50 a night over a weekend average price, we thought what the hell. My brother is so cheap that he still wears shirts from when he was in High school, (he is currently 36). Regardless we thought 3 *s (official rating on most websites) all we really need is 2 beds and a bathroom. Well being blunt if this is 3 Stars then I think the box under the bridge with the homeless must rank at least 2 stars! there was no chair for the desk (how did that leave the room?) the decor looked like Jimmy buffet threw up after drinking one too many different colored margaritas, the carpet was just dirty, the bathroom had mold in the corners of the linoleum floor, There was a foot hole kicked through the bathroom door. But the wings at the bar downstairs were good!
397	0	Okay, so I have heard really great and raging reviews of this place and was really hyped to check it out for the first time! I came here with a friend who's been here a numerous amounts of times.  The decor and ambiance of this place was actually fantastic. It reminded me of the bubblegum candy land and a little bit of sexy hip at the same time.   The wait was about 25minutes, not bad for dinner on a weekday, and we were seated promptly inside with a view of the strip. That night we saw Penn & Teller eating dinner on the outside balcony, poor guys couldn't even enjoy their night being bothered by tourists and fans, let the men eat!! **My little highlight for the night!**  For dinner I ordered the Salmon Caesar Salad with homemade Garlic Parmesan Croutons that cost almost close to $20 (but it was a huge mixing  bowl portion) While the size might have given you your money's worth, the fish was too fishy and half cooked, the lettuce was drowning in a mayonnaise based Caesar dressing so It was soggy. The only good thing was the Garlic bread/over sized croutons. The disappointment of my night.   After my not-so-appetizing dinner, i was sort of looking forward to a dessert called the Frozen Hot Chocolate, but didn't get the chance to because they ran out of ingredients, so they suggested the hot chocolate sundae. What? isn't it chocolate and ice that you need to make this dessert? Ugh So we opted for the Strawberry Fields Sundae, cheesecake, strawberry ice cream, strawberry topping with whipped cream all for $15.00!!! SERIOUSLY? There was two scoops of ice cream on the bottom of a goblet topped with strawberry compote and LOADS of whip cream. Really is that necessary?   In the end, I made a note to myself that I will never come here again, nor will I suggest this place to anybody. Chili's or Apple-bees in my opinion makes better quality foods at a decent-not-so-overrated price!   Never again.
456	0	I have been to brazilian steakhouses before and as their salad bar didnt have too many options. I wasn't disappointed. The men who bring around the meat were polite and did a great job! Me and my boyfriend received a free dinner voucher with them and ended up, upgrading to experience the flipper card dinner. At the end, the waiter brought us our check (we waited longer it felt for the check then it did for us to eat our meal) he explained with the voucher how mich our meal wouldve been and how much it was (free +  our upgrade) and how much we should tip based off howuch the check would have been. Ok great. We had our xash together as we had waited awhile to pay. Instead of letting him walk away, my boyfriend put the cash into the check thing and the waiter opened it up, counted our money and explained we did not tip enough based off his calculations. Excuse me, but we did leave a decent tip and no maybe wasnt based off a 100 check but, we didnt come there expecting to pay or tip on that. We were completely embarrassed as the waiter got loud in counting our money amd telling us it wasnt enough.. the tables next to us could hear and were staring. Forst of all, we were there for 20/30 minutes. Our waiter brought us water and we had a go with the meat one time. I didnt feel good leaving there and in all honesty if we couldve stiffed his ass, we wouldve. That is NOT how you treat a customer no matter how much their bill was. Shame on you guys! If you dont like the vouchers than i suggest you opt out of being apart of it. And his snooty ass can finally make better tips! How dare he!!! My boyfriend ended up tipping beyond even the pro rated calculations against my idea of leaving him even less for the sheer embarrassment he brought to us during dinner on our vacation. So i hope you spent it well!!
689	0	Empty dining room at 7:30 pm?  Should've know it would suck.  If I'm paying $20 bucks for below-mediocre tex mex could I have a glass instead of a frat party plastic cup?  I'm trying to think of something that I liked about this place besides my company and I can only come up with "well, at least I didn't get food poisoning".
1893	0	This place gets 2.5 stars.  I went to the original one in NYC and I remember it being more whimsical and better back then. My group of friends wanted to go really badly, and at the end of the day, I ended up going with 3 guys-- all of whom were super stoked to go. Unfortunately it was a disappointing experience for everyone.   ATMOSPHERE Same decor as the one in NYC but not as cramped. The music made it less cute (they were blasting hip hop) and service sucked.  There weren't any tables available so we sat at the bar. Bad idea... (explanation below)  FOOD We came here for the FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE, which was way more magical in our heads. Most people got their own, but my boyfriend and I decided to share because I knew how big the portions were. It's honestly enough for 2 people to share and the bartender even asked my 2 guy friends if they were going to share one, haha.  The frozen hot chocolate was good, but it wasn't anything special. What totally broke our spirits was seeing them make it. Since we sat at the bar, we discovered that the coveted HC was POWDER MIXED WITH ICE... it pretty much shattered our hopes and dreams, making the experience way less enjoyable.  Overall, this place is TOO overrated and overpriced. There are better places to blow your money in Vegas!
248	1	First time here and was very impressed with the food, ambience and service. The interior is nicely designed to allow for a very pleasant dining experience. And the servers are very attentive and friendly.   The food here is delicious. This is what we ordered:  -spicy tuna kimbap -spicy soft tofu -Harami miso -Korean prime kalbi -Beef toro  -Salmon  -Korean chicken with cheese fondue  -bibimbap  The beef is very tender and soft. It just melts in your mouth! The beef toro wasn't as tender as if anticipated. The   Korean prime kalbi was delicious but I would have to say that the Harami Miso was my favorite. The spicy tuna kimbap is good but it's very heavy. It'd be wise to take it slow with that! The chicken was very soft and tender surprisingly, but the cheese part really wasn't for me. The spicy tofu soup was very flavorful and delicious. It definitely helps settle all the bbq that you just ate.   Overall, quality and and atmosphere are on point here. I would definitely come back here in the future.   ***the amount of food was for a party of 3 and it was more than enough.
801	1	AWESOME find.  One of those,  how did we get there? Im so glad we found this place, kind of experiences for my group of 4.  Service was great- our waiter was funny, attentive and CRAZY fast.  We shared a few plates including the shishito peppers, octopus balls (not the best but not bad), onion rings ( AMAZING, we should have ordered 4 orders instead of 1) and we each got a noodle bowl or a burger for our mains.  Broth was delish of my noodles and the noodles were good, but the chewier ramen from the dish with the XO sauce had better texture.  Pork belly pieces were like bits of porky heaven- honestly it was very memorable and delicious.  Cannot stress enough how good the onion rings were.  As a bit of a onion ring connoisseur I have to say they rank at the top of my lifetime list, and they were incredible inexpensive.  MUST GO BACK!  You need to go and try this place out, now :)
119	0	So a vegetarian walks into a burger joint.... But seriously, my two partners wanted burgers and this place boasted a veggie burger, so I was sold! Result? Food was good! I did the Inferno Burger with a black bean patty (skip the warm lettuce) and add onion strings. It was yummy, good kick of spice and the patty was charred to perfection, just enough to crispiness. My boyfriend fell in love with the bacon & eggs sliders. He called the mini quail eggs cute- and devoured them. My BFF had the Dante with a turkey patty and loved it- especially the blue cheese. Bad news though!! Service was bad, bad, bad. They need to look at their staffing plans- our server was swamped with too many tables! She was filling drink orders, ringing up checks and helping at least 6 tables; meanwhile, 2 hosts were standing around doing nothing. At least 4 guys were bussing tables and done, standing around with nothing to do. There were at least 4 bartenders, yet they were all standing together taking. My drink never came, and we had no utensils while our food sat at our table. The saving grace was how nice and apologetic our server was!
1265	1	This pizza is BOMB, period.   IMO, it's kinda cool that it's pretty much a hole in the wall and that they don't advertise it. One of those exclusive things where you have to know about it through word of mouth. Almost as if it were my own little secret.  As far as for you negative Nancys comparing this plave to NY. Get a grip, it's not New York, it's Las Vegas. You will never get NY pizza anywhere but NY. It's like going to NY to a casino (idk if they have them or not) and say well these arn't like Las Vegas...duuhhh.
838	0	First of all, if you're in a Tix 4 Tonight line wondering whether or not you should buy a discount ticket to the Cravings buffet, I'd advise you to choose another place.  But more about that at the end of my review.  The food itself was nothing to get very excited about.  The high point was the Andouille sausage which had a kick to it and real flavor.  Ironically, the low point was the Cajun chicken, which looked the part but had little flavor and was so dry it was barely edible (and I prefer dry poultry to juicy).  The rest of the food, as many pointed out, was pretty bland, kind of like Golden Corral with less choices.  They do have free alcohol, so if you're more interested in drinking than eating, this may be the place for you.  I don't drink, so this was little consolation for me.  Another Yelper recommended getting a discount coupon.  I had one and came at about 1:00 PM for lunch.  The coupon (from Tix 4 Tonight) listed a lunch price of $11.99.  There were three of us, so I was expecting to pay about $40.  Imagine my shock when the Cashier announced my bill was about $80.  I told her I wanted lunch and she told me they weren't serving lunch "today."  I went ahead and paid and immediately checked their website on my phone only to discover today meant ever.  There is no reference to lunch, only Breakfast, Brunch and Dinner.  Is the Mirage or Tix 4 Tonight to blame for the bait and switch/misrepresentation?  I guess that's a question for the Nevada Attorney General to figure out, I'll update to post any response I get from them.  But given the cashier's slick reply I'm guessing it's the Mirage.
1303	0	Harold and Kumar traveled how far for these dumb burgers...  Totally not worth the hype. My ex stoner roommate was obsessed with White Castle and used to buy the frozen ones.. So when I tried these for the 1st time I couldn't believe how it tastes exactly the same (yuk)  People were buying them by the case when we walked in, total disappointment. People in the east coast got it all wrong these soggy sliders are crappy. Another reason the west coast rules.
544	0	Wow.  Wish I had checked Yelp before eating here.  The place is kinda neat looking - bunch of little goldfish, some of which swim upside down (for fun??)  Food is terrible.  Don't be fooled by the cheong-sam dressed Asians they have at the front.  Actually, that should have been a warning sign.  It being a "Chinese restaurant" in Caesar's should have been warning enough.  The place advertises itself as "authentic" hand-pulled noodles.  Yes, it's noodles.  And NO, it ain't authentic.  Supposedly their "best-seller" was the hand pulled noodles with shrimp/pork wontons.    The noodles were the WORST I have had in a long time.  Soggy, sad, thin little things with no texture.  Wontons were nothing to write home about.  Soup was on par with Cup O Noodles broth.  A relatively small bowl of -- blah -- for:                                          ****   $17.00  ****  Tip: DON'T GO.  Or, if you must go, don't expect authentic food.  (ps - the one star is for the cute fish!)
1061	0	Tao Nightclub deserves this 1 star, but it's also getting 1 start to outweigh the review that my friend posted for a 4 star review.....but he can't count his experience!!!  He had an all expenses paid trip to LV and all drinks were paid for at Tao by Virgin Airlines and not to mention it was on a Wednesday night!!  Seriously!  Tao is COMPLETELY overrated.  The dance floor is tiny, there are columns in the way so you can't even people watch if you are one of the wall flowers, the bartenders (male and female) are REALLY bitchy and the service is terrible.  The millions of buddha faces start to look scarey after awhile and the atmosphere is stuffy.  No me gusta!  Pure is a MILLION times cooler than this place.  I went twice and haven't returned, I'll leave it for the celebrities who are paid to be there or my friends who get free trips to Vegas and free drinks at Tao! ;)
406	0	Meh...food is ok, service removing plates from table was good.  The choices were not that alluring.  In the Latin area there were nacho chips???  I liked the Asian noodles and beef with peppers, and the tiramisu dessert.  My husband enjoyed the prime rib. Neither of us liked the crab legs, they were split in half and didn't have much flavor.  At least, this was included in our stay here at the Mirage.  I would NEVER pay for this buffet.
196	1	DEFINITELY WORTH THE DRIVE We found our way here by accident last year and made a point of going back this year. Everything is delicious that we have ordered. Pork carnitas skillet was perfection. Apple cinnamon pancakes were delicious as was the often-mentioned banana nut muffin. Come hungry or share...they are generous with their portions.
1913	1	I'm back home in Cali and I already want to go back to Vegas just so I can eat here again!  I saw the Ox-Tail Fries on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives and I craved it so bad.  It was really good.  The fried egg on top just made it even better.  The ox tail meat was savory and soft, melt in your mouth.  I tried the Ronin Burger, which is the most popular but I didn't really like it.  There was too much carmelized onions which I usually love but it made the burger too sweet.  My husband had the Miyagi-san's Wagyu Burger and it was so awesome!!  I ate half of his burger.  It was really savory and just good.  I wanted to try their Boba drinks but I was too full after.  I can't wait to go back again!
685	1	Another success for Thomas Keller.  Located on the quieter back side of the Venetian, this large French restaurant is great for lunch or dinner, but the best for Sunday brunch.  It gets busy quick so either come early or be prepared to wait.   There is fresh seafood that greets you behind the host's platform.  I suggest a dozen oysters and a spicy bloody mary to get things started.  Almost everything on the menu is delicious, and they always have a few specials including an omlette/egg dish.  If you have room at the end, have some french press coffee and the beignets.  This is my recipe for happiness.  Oh yeah, finish by waddling back to your room, having some afternoon nookie (optional), and then taking a fat ass nap.  Life is good.
1188	1	Me and my family went early around 730am or so and I have never been here before, the young gentleman who was really young was very swell and respectful and was caring that I had a infant and I thank him for being caring about him. Well mannered, our waiter was knowledgeable and very cool, I didn't catch his name but had a great sleeved tattooed on his right arm. The muffins are out of this world, they were so hot and fresh I was worried I want going to have room for my actual breakfast  The eggs bennidict were so delicious had a great zest to the sauce. The potatoes would have been great but there was a large amount of pepper and there specialty El Diablo of some sort of spice they created but ask them for easy on the spice. Other that great food good price. Had to take the remainder of my portion a home and I would go back
1861	0	I wandered the Strip with some girlfriends during Memorial Day weekend and stumbled upon Noodles in the Bellagio.   First, the hostesses took a while to seat us despite the fact that there were several empty tables in the restaurant. Once we were seated, and we ordered our food, it took a really long time for it to come out. I'm a pretty patient person, and I would not say gluttony is a deadly sin of mine, but wow the food took SO LONG to come out. If the restaurant was busier I would understand, but wow it took literally more than half an hour after we ordered, and we only had five people in our party. Food was alright...kind of mediocre, I wouldn't come here again (& for more reasons below!). The five of us each got different dishes and they were okay...pretty subpar. I guess being Asian, you have a bit of a higher standard for noodle dishes, but as non-biased as I am trying to be, the food here was below average.  The worst part came AFTER we left Noodles. One of my friends had an allergic reaction to the food (she ordered the pad thai) after we left. She had trouble breathing and broke out in hives everywhere until she took some Benadryl to alleviate the reaction. She is allergic to nuts, not peanuts (peanuts are legumes, not nuts!), so we assumed there may have been other nuts in the pad thai they might have not listed on the menu. We called the restaurant to let them know of this and after talking to several (at least 3) people at the restaurant, they repeatedly just read the menu to us and said she might've had a reaction to the peanuts. Like I said...she is not allergic to peanuts and orders pad thai all the time. There were probably other products in the food that were processed in a place with nuts, we assumed. We talked to the manager and he was very apologetic over the phone, got our information down (what hotel we were staying at, what room, how bad the reaction was, etc.), and insisted that he send someone up to our hotel room to check on my friend. She was feeling a little better (able to breathe, thank God), but we agreed to the person coming up to check on her just to make sure she was okay. We waited quite a while in the hotel room...no one came up. The manager ended the phone call with "Sorry about that, hope you feel better." ...thanks, NOODLES.  Overall experience: mediocre food and bad customer service (even before my friend got sick). And then they did not keep their promise of having someone come up to our hotel room at the Monte Carlo. Yes, my friend did feel better after taking Benadryl, but after getting our information down and extensive phone conversations with us regarding the situation, and all of us waiting in our room, you would think management would come through. We also e-mailed them after we left Vegas a couple days later about this, but no response. -_-  Get it together, NOODLES!
627	0	$6.50 for mediocre tacos? 20 kinds of veggie fried rice $25, add chicken $5= $30(Tiny portion), 8 pieces miniscule shrimp at $29, shrimp & pork dumplings (8pcs) at $25, beers at $8?  Taste and flavor were so-so at best. Definitely not worth the price tag.
218	0	Its true what they say, "you get for what you pay for".  From the start of our visit, the room was dirty.  The bathroom was obviously used, bed was undone, there was beer cans in the trash, and the sink was filled with dirty water! Really!!!  I call room service which took them a good 20 minutes to get here, not to mention the other 10 to 15 minutes it took the maid to clean it.  On top of all of this, the ice machine was broken, the TV remote did not work, and there was no mini fridge.  I digress, really!!  Its true that its the cheapest of the bunch, but come on, really?!!  I caution everyone before they book a room here.  It would of been nice if they comp the room for us or at least give us another room.  Oh by the way, i'm still waiting for the engineers to come to my room and fix the TV/remote control.  Been waiting 20 minutes now.  Only nice thing about this place, is that its right next to the monoreal which drops you of on the strip.
204	0	If i could rate Cabo Wabo a negative score I would.   We arrive just in time for Karaoke, which I would give 5 Stars.  But that's where the good ends.   We were not actually sat by the hostess just pointed toward the tables. No menus, so I'm assuming the frat boy waiter assumed we didn't want service. When I asked for menus he looked at me like I was nuts. Then 5 seconds after getting the menus he asked us, "so are you gonna order something?" Really?  He never asked us if wanted drinks, I went up to the Bar to get mine. For a weak 8 oz margarita it was TWENTY DOLLARS!!!! For a pre-made Slurpee with house alcohol!!     I would never go back there again. They treated us like trash and we did nothing to deserve it.   And to top it off I accidentally left an expensive souvenir behind, when I returned they didn't have a lost n found they said "we just throw it away". I tried to express the whole experience to the manager, his response was "oh well".   WOW - worst service EVER!
187	1	Crazy Bernie is a big fan of Gordon's and puts his money where his mouth is by going into this great spot each and every time he goes to Paris LV about 4x a year. Beef Wellington just like what they make on Hell's Kitchen is out of this world. Got to meet chef Christine the first time I went soon after she won the head chef position.  Highest quality food with prices in line with quality level. When you say no to Gordon Ramsey Steak....you say no to life!
1548	1	Hands down the best steakhouse I've been to in Vegas! Romantic and classy atmosphere. Very dim lighting.   *This place is packed, so reserve weeks ahead! We were lucky to get a 10pm seating when we called 3 days ahead, which is very late but we weren't rushed to finish our foods. A lot of people were still dining here even when we left around 11:30-12.  Service was excellent and professional. Our waiter put our napkins on our laps. Everything came out at a nice speed. Easy to flag down someone if you need something.  Everything we ordered was really good! Even the complimentary breads were yummy!   Bone Marrow- salty fatty goodness Bone-In Rib Eye- so tender and juicy, very big portion! Beef Wellington- omg this was so soft and melt-in-your-mouth good! Must order! Fingerling potatoes- mm truffled flavor  We also ordered a half bottle of Pinor Noir- Domaine Drouhin (2010). Our waiter gave a small tasting of the wine to make sure we liked it.  We didn't finish all the food we ordered and took a good amount of food to-go. We were so stuffed!   We spent a little over $200, but less than $250 which was expected. Definitely a place you would want to splurge! And not worry about the bill.
16	1	Visiting Las Vegas for the weekend and saw that this place had some pretty great reviews. People weren't kidding, it's FANTASTIC. Our server was Liza and she was SO attentive, kind, and helpful. True definition of a great waitress. Everyone's plate was clean at the end of breakfast. I was very impressed with this place and will definitely seek it out again when I'm back in Vegas.
1727	1	Lotus of Siam is a stunning surprise in a city built on either shockingly cheap or shockingly expensive.  Lotus is very good with reasonable prices.  Located in a very random strip mall and (according to our cab driver) dangerous neighborhood, Lotus is a great surprise for out-of-town visitors.    While the reputation of this restaurant precedes it, we were pleasantly surprised.  The food is not fancy but when exiting customers report that it's "worth the wait" to those waiting in 104 degree heat, you know you're know you're spending time well worth waiting.  Upon seating, we noted the myriad of photographs of famous (and mysterious) patrons who have eaten at Lotus.    From the San Francisco Bay Area, where Thai restaurants are found on every corner, I found Lotus to capture traditional flavors, especially in the Crispy Rice appetizer and the large shrimp fried in their shells (which was amazing).  Aside from the scorching summer heat, the level of spiciness in the dishes can KO the novice.  The Thai pepper "salsa" is only for those with asbestos mouths--don't think that cucumber and carrots will save you, they won't.  It was too hot even for our guide who had been there weekly for over nine months.    Overall, the meal was exciting.  I look forward going back to Las Vegas to so I may return to Lotus.
332	1	We were at UNLV for the day and wanted to grab something to eat. I haven't had Korean Barbecue in a long time but this was a great re-introduction to Korean cuisine. I had bulgogi and fried dumplings, which were both great. The serving size was perhaps a little small, so just be sure to order enough food. The service was also pretty good as we were well attended through our time here.
264	1	My families experience at Bouchon was AMAZING! Getting to the restaurant was a bit tricky, just remember there's an elevator that takes you to Bouchon in the lobby of the parking garage! Venetian has a sign leading you to the Bouchon cafe but the full restaurant is on the 10th floor...there was a couple in front of us that messed up EXACTLY like us so I didn't feel as dumb "p we arrived at the restaurant and were seated within 5 minutes. My son (1.5), daughter (4), husband and myself got sat at a 4 top and the hostess brought crayons and pages for them to color. But we realized they cover their tables in paper!!! My babies loved drawing on the table!   Our server wasn't anything special. She didn't ignore my kids and I appreciated that. We ordered orange juice and: French TOAST - HOLY COW!!! This was the best french toast EVER. You can not have breakfast at Bouchon without ordering this!! The butter it was served with i could have ate with a spoon! Steak sandwich - the bread was perfect, our steak was perfect medium, the peppers and onions gave a great texture contrast. I will be ordering this again for sure!! Beignets - they were ok at best... Cinnamon apple oatmeal- totally regret ordering this. It was crazy watery and had ZERO flavor. We added all the brown sugar and even 3 packets of natural sugar but still..yuck. Luckily my son ate some.  I loved the French Toast and steak sandwich so much Bouchon gets 5 stars and I deem it as one of the best breakfasts I have EVER had!! I literally can't wait to go back!!
1217	0	Location and idea are great . Food is not all that The meat kinda lacks taste . But they have an open salad bar which has some good stuff.  Service is very slow and they refused to give us to go boxes !!! My husband was sick and didn't eat at all so I wanted to take his food to eat later , ended up going somewhere else later to eat. Definitely wouldn't go back
634	0	Apparently desperate times call for desperate measures.   I stayed here last year for the Singapore Math convention and swore blind never again to patronize this hotel... I hate it when I find myself having to eat my words...  This year, I'm attending the same conference with a friend who, after four rounds of chemotherapy has difficulty walking and in need of frequent naps. With such limited options, I reluctantly re-booked the hotel.  The staff were lackluster last year and this time, again, they didn't disappoint.   They made it clear that they would not provide any special services in spite of my friend's afflicted state. I could get a coffee-maker for my sparsely furnished (but clean) room - but that would cost me $40 for our three nights.  I wished I could say we made up for it with cheap room rates... we didn't... our pitiful room cost $99 a night - special conference rates, apparently. A horrific rip-off, even by Las Vegas standards, especially considering we have to walk through 110 deg temperatures in the outdoors to get to the restaurants.  Next year, we're putting the room rental money towards taxi fares from the Bellagio.  Boooooooo.
412	0	Positives: Smoke free section of the casino Beds are really comfortable Monorail station at hotel  Ok now for the review. So we are in town for a convention and wanted to stay a few days extra to enjoy Vegas. Decided to book a few nights at LVH because there was a deal I couldn't pass up on a travel site. So we check in and I ask about an upgrade to a room with a refrigerator and was told that there was the newly updated rooms for $20 extra a night with all these extra features like in room coffee and the requested refrigerator. Then in looking at the site there is not much difference in the $10 extra and $20 extra a night. In room coffee maker, yeah my morning caffeine. Until I pick up the cup and read the lid.... $3.50 per cup used. I can get a venti coffee at Starbucks cheaper. Even the room service coffee was a better deal at 2 cups for $5.75. $18 a day resort fee and I have to pay $3.50 a cup of coffee and can only connect one device to the wifi connection. While I am not a big fan of resort fees, usually don't complain too much when I have coffee, wifi, newspaper, gym etc.However,  the resort fee here doesn't cover much and only seems to be an additional fee to increase their bottom line. Now even with the fee, It was a better price than the other hotels with a price of $38 a night for a Thursday and Friday night with major conventions in town. That being said I don't think I will be staying here again. I am in Vegas twice a year at least for work and think I will stick with the hotels I know and have stayed at many times in the past.

The chicken and waffles as simply as I would put it, is the must try.  Bacon in your gravy? No Way!  Chicken was done magnificently with the right crisp and texture.  Definitely would visit again when in Vegas.
1047	1	The food was incredible. There are inside and outside seating options available. There is no reservations (first come first serve) but the wait was less than 5 minutes. The menu is excellent. The place is rated as $$$ but my wife and I ate an incredible meal for under 50 dollars. The corn beef hash is out of this world good. Probably the best i tasted so far. My wife ordered bread pudding which didn't disappoint either. The bacon was a separate charge of 5 dollars, but it was cooked to perfection. Most defiantly a place I would eat again.
1382	0	We were on the 19th floor and we still could hear the traffic below and ambulance sirens going down Tropicana Blvd. The walls and windows are extremely thin. We could hear everything our neighbors did and said. The mattresses were very firm and the piloows were goose down rocks. The decor was lovely, though. No shower cap. Very, very long walk from the elevators to our room. They really need to install a few more elevators because that walk from room 200 to room 335 was ridiculous. They need more shade by the pools, otherwise you will burn like hell in 117+ degree weather, which is what it was this past weekend. The buffet was $40 for lunch and dinner, $30 for breakfast and brunch, and it wasnt the best, but it wasnt horrible. Crab legs were water logged. Good dessert bar though. But what really makes me never want to return was the $28/night resort fee they charge you upon check out.  Add that to the room tax of $15.25, and there is an additional $43/night on top of your room fee. Oh, and you couldnt use the in-room fridge without paying and using a combination to unlock it.  And the TV kept losing reception, along with the internet, which made that resort fee even more absurd. Definitely wont be back.  Trump Towers, Vdara, and Wynn are much better for the money.
1324	1	I live in LA, so I go to Vegas pretty often, and since I'm also a Yelp fiend, Lotus of Siam had been on my list for many years. Since I rarely wander off the Strip, I managed to miss it on every trip until a couple months back, when I made the trip with a few friends.  We booked well in advance, but were able to change a table for 3 to a table for 5 the day of our dinner. Our reservation was for 8:30 on a Monday, so probably not a peak time, though the place was very busy the whole time we were there. (You can also walk in, apparently, but it sounds like the waits get long.) The restaurant was in a huge strip mall, with the kind of parking lot ideal for teaching teens to drive, or testing specially modified DeLoreans. The space itself was comfortable--not small for a family-run Thai restaurant in the desert, but not big for what could be Vegas's most hyped off-Strip attraction.  I liked the atmosphere, which was homey but upbeat, with tons of accolades and celebrity photos on the wall (though the only person I recognized was Asian fiend Nick Cage). Ah, the bald boastfulness of accomplished immigrants--I know it well. Service was good, fast and attentive, even as a crowd of dishes created near chaos on our table.  The food was excellent, every bite loaded to bursting with flavor. We ordered a family style feast, and everything was delicious and satisfying in that way that makes you wonder, why eat at fancy restaurants when Thai food is just better? Lotus of Siam outshines most restaurants on the Strip, and its price point is a lot more friendly.  The moo yang was irresistible, a plate of marinated charbroiled pork, tenderly chewy with a caramelized char, served with a homemade spicy dipping sauce. The papaya salad was classic--green papaya, chili, tomato, crushed peanuts, lime juice, fish sauce, sugar--and nicely executed, made with a ton of heat. One of Lotus of Siam's signature dishes, which I'd never had anywhere else, was the garlic prawn. I can see why people talk come here for this--it was utterly addictive, deep fried prawns sauted in a house garlic sauce and topped with ground black pepper. Tons of flavor, and a flaky, chip-like texture. I don't tend to love prawn shells, but these were put to beautiful use.  The bulk of our meal came in the form of curries and carbs. The khao soi was another house specialty--crispy duck on egg noodles in a curry-based sauce, garnished with scallions, lime, and pickled vegetables. This was spectacular, somewhere between a noodle soup and a curry, with a thick, complex sauce that was thin enough to eat by the spoonful. I also loved the kang hung lay, a spicy stewy Northern pork curry. The portion was small, but the contents were rich, the pork cooked so tender it was falling apart in the curry. On the more everyday Thai side of things, I really enjoyed the panang curry with chicken, and the pineapple fried rice was solid.  The check came before we could order dessert--it's possible our server thought we'd had quite enough, which wasn't inaccurate. There's always next time--now that I've been to Lotus of Siam, I'll drag people off the Strip to go back.
1197	0	This was my 4th time staying at this hotel for a convention next door and I will never go back!  The last 3 years I have been downgraded from the Grand Room to a crappy room and all they offer me is a smoking room when I have complained.  I don't know why they take reservations they are unable to fulfill. This year the lady at the front desk double talked me and said we have been upgraded from the Grand room to a resort club room for an extra $10 per night.  When we got up to the room, it turned out to be another crappy room.  I immediately called down to the front desk to complain but was told they sold out of Grand rooms.  They considered me upgraded because my room was supposed to have robes, slippers & a free bottle of water, NONE of which was in our room.  I was told to call housekeeping about getting those items sent up.  We were also given gold keys to another room on another floor, which apparently had food and drinks but only open limited hours so we never did have a chance to see that.  So, thats what they considered an "upgrade" and tried to charge me more for.  I ended up calling the manager the next day and they took $30 off but to me it wasn't worth it at all.   The room was supposedly updated but it looked the same as it did the last 4 years, broken lighted mirror and not vacuumed.   Bottom line is I will never go back!
710	1	Love love this place.The orange juice is freshly squeezed and sweet. Worth the money they charge. Big portions and reasonably priced. Very clean, great customer service. Haven't had a bad experience yet. Open 24/7 which is a good thing. The pastas are really good.
1435	0	epic disappointment.... although my standards were not high on this one... similar opinion to Gold Nugget buffet heading in....  somehow they managed to really let me down.... food was bad quality, service was subpar and just an overall forgettable experience...   definitely go somewhere else.... you can do a ton better within a 10 minute walk on the strip.....
1393	0	The buffet selection is not good... its too expensive! The food is so dry...30dollars per person for dinner? Its too expensive! Have better a food if u will changer 30 dollars! i will not recommend this place for buffet. Better try wicked spoon at cosmopolitan so far the best buffet ever!
732	1	Delicious food and great service! We had the prime rib Benny and strawberry cream French toast. The potatoes that come with the Benny are soooo good; crispy and well-seasoned. Perry and the other staff were very attentive and friendly. :) I recommend if you have a larger group, call ahead and make a reservation  And don't forget to check in and get a free, warm banana nut muffin!
494	0	There isn't really much to say about this place because I didn't enjoy it that much...but I don't really enjoy any buffets outside of vegas and for the price you paid I guess you get that 2 stars. Regardless...you wait in a long line(I'm assuming due to it's cheap price) and you can get a drink...I prefer you not to get a drink because you don't even get to refill it yourself and it's like 1.99 which is alright but flagging down your "waiter/waitress"just to get you another drink is kinda missing the point of Buffet? Anyway I'm not entirely sure on the drinks price but I think my friend paid around $11 for his lunch and soft drink so sounds about right.  Regardless I don't find any of the dishes memorable as they all tasted either too bland or too salty. I honestly don't know if i can really complain about it cause you shouldn't expect much but yea. The memorable part for me is that dessert you get to have cookies and cream, pecan, and 2 other flavors of ice cream and it's unlimited so that's something to look forward to even though it's not the best ice cream you'll ever taste but it certainly beats having only vanilla and chocolate ice cream all the time.  Anyway...my tastebud is spoiled so you can give it a try if you want but I don't see myself coming to this buffet any time soon.
1157	0	Some girlfriends and I spent the weekend of 4/20 in Vegas...which was kinda amazing. But do you know what lacked amazingness? This place!  My friend REALLY wanted to go here because she has some kind of "foodie crush" on the dude that opened the place. Or the head chef. Or someone important like that. We all assumed it was going to be a Mexican/Chinese fusion- but the two sides of the menu (and the dishes) are completely separate.  While the atmosphere, and the idea, are both super fun, the place lacks execution. I was not a fan of my soup, and while my lemon shrimp were bomb in flavor, they didn't sit well later!  With so many culinary gems in the city of sin, I suggest you indulge elsewhere!
1599	1	Best Thai food in Vegas! People take trips here via taxis from the Strip.   Food is dee-lish with a wide range of wine. I eat a lot of Thai food from LA to NY and this place sticks out!  Featured in Top Chef Master (Las Vegas). When I saw this episode, I was hollaaaaa-ing "I was there!!". This place is excellent and always packed. Way worth the trip; try everything! Come hungry.  Food: Sea bass with Pad Kee Mao (5/5) Drinks: 2 full cups of the best Thai tea everrrr!! (6/5)
999	0	Let me get to the point right now... DO NOT EAT HERE!  This was a BOMB from start to finish and a complete waste of $157.00 for 4 people.  We made reservations.  When we showed up the hostess tried to put us outside where everyone walks by you. We noticed that's whereshe tries to put everyone initially. It's obviously is an effort to gain attention of by-passers, who think "wow, let's eat here, it's so busy".   It's very impersonal area, so we said we will sit inside.  So now she makes us wait for like 7+ minutes.  The inside was nearly empty and we still waited.  The waitress looked "frazzled" that we choise to eat inside.  So she seats us next to an entry way like a thoroughfare, but this place is nearly empty.  Many nice tables available.  Then we waited nearly 10 minutes for someone to say "hi" I'm your waiter/waitress.  We were just ready to leave this place when out of the blue, a waitress greets us with a really bad vibe, unhappy feeling, impersonable to say the least.  So I order the unlimited meat thing for $37.95 or close to that price.  Well to keep this short, the meat carving people DO NOT make their rounds consistently.  They leave you waiting for more than 10-15 minutes at a time before another meat arrives.  I sat there looking around thinking what the heck is going on here?  Then someone shows up.  You can feel the reluctancy to carve you any decent sized portion.  Then you wait 10-15 minutes... another person comes, you get the picture???  One of my guests had a halibut fish at $27.99.  It was sadly the size of a king-sized pack of cigarettes, with some steamed veggies and that was a bit dry.  This was a let down.  My wife's dish was a lobster bouilliabaise.  The dish was mediocre, the tiny shrimp you had to find in the soup, the mussels were so tiny that I cant believe they would serve that!  The pasta was overcooked.  They only served me 5  types of meat while there. The filet mignon was the only one I could comfortably chew.  The rest of the meat was not very tender and tasty.  We over-heard our waitress complaining to another one saying the meat service is affecting her tips.   Yes it does, and so does her crappy personality.  Let me tell all of you that read this.  This place survives, thanks to the countless tourist turn-over.  This place is so desperate, they hand-out discount coupons in front of their place to the people that walk by....if you walk in because you wanted to anyhow, no discount coupon offer for you!   Plus take in mind my earlier comment about how thay want you to sit out front so they can market you to other suckers walking by. This place is no better than an average dinner buffet for $12.95.  I should have payed attention to the other Yelper comments out there, and I got burned.  Oh yeah, our seats were badly covered in grease drippings and other spills left behind from customers.  Gross!  One last thing, when we left, we walked by a hostess or a waitress who was using a company computer moniter station area  to check her FaceBook photos.... "class act" here people.  You can see, this place is a BOMB from start to finish.  Take my advice.... and others.... just pass over this place, it should close it's doors... for good.
898	0	If you are a tourist this is probably one of the best options on the stip to go and dance latin music. However, if you are a local I would not recommended.  This restaurant/bar has two floors: the first floor has the restaurant area where you can eat next to the dance floor. They play R&B, rap and a little bit of everything. The problem is that is next to the patio so I don't think they have AC, or if they do is extremely hot!! ( I promise you I'm not on my menopause yet and I was sweaty). on the second floor, they play Latin music, the dance floor  has a decent size, but I went on a Saturday night and there was hardly anyone there.. So if you have better option, I would totally go somewhere else.
426	0	Don't bother! We were greeted by some blonde hostess girl who was being EXTRA rude to everyone who had a question....we asked how long the wait was and they said  it was a 30 to 40 mins but we were on our way out of Vegas so we went to the To Go side....... All 4 of us ordered the bacon cheeseburger which was literally the size of a McDonald's hamburger it came with cheese and bacon no condiments not lettuce or tomatoes with fries an extra large soda for $16 each!!! We could have gone to In n out and spent that much on 2 meals I wanted rootbeer as my drink so They had to give me a small because the rootbeer is more expensive?????.  The banana split my friend ordered was not spectacular I could have made a better one at home plus it wouldn't cost nearly as much.
1519	0	Got to say this was the second Halloween we have spent here, this year and last year.  Very disappointed.  We had a group of ten plus people for two years and a row.  We ate dinner, it was mediocre at best.  Chicken tacos where dry and no flavor, basically just cooked chicken with cheese on top.  Enchiladas were ok, I could do a better job cooking at home, kind of sad for Vegas.  Last night oct 31, 2014, partied all night there after dinner.  Spent $60+ on dinner, plus $35 for all you can drink for myself and $55 for my wife's top shelf all you can drink.  Pretty reasonable drinking price for Vegas, but by 2 am tried to order tap water, in my all you can drink cup, and the bartender said $4 for a bottled water.  I said no tap water for free in my cup, he said no again trying to get me to buy a bottled water.  As we argued back and forth I finally gave up.  My wife went to the manager and complained how much money we spent for all you can drink and dinner, and that we should at least get our free water.  Crazy!  Then during the costume contest confetti was sprayed throughout the crowd, of course what do you do with confetti other than throw it.  Everyone was doing it, but the manager came over and grabbed my hand said not to throw the confetti.  He then grabbed my wife's hand too, I told him to let her go.  I can't believe he had the nerve to put his hand on her.  I was so pissed.  Unbelievable this guy is a manager.  This will be the last time our group goes to seor frogs.
465	1	All you need to know: THE BEST SKINNY FRIES I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. EVER.  Perfectly cut, not greasy, perfectly salted, crunchy outside, soft hot inside. I ate every last one and I could have eaten more.  So it is no secret that I love Hubert Keller.  I have the hugest crush on him with his French accent, charming smile, and gray ponytail.  And I don't typically crush on older men, that's a fact.  I also love how he's always adorably sweet and encouraging on the Top Chef shows.  And his PBS shows make it look easy to make souffle...yeah, right, but he makes it look easy.  So we went to Burger Bar after an unintended visit to the airport to retrieve my BF's lost ID.  Ugh.  This place looks like an updated more upscale diner with booths, tables, and bar seating.  Get your fave type of seating and get ready to stuff yourself!  Burgers are either "build your own" or Chef's burgers that are already designed with toppings, etc.  They even have veggie burgers and fish burgers so if you don't like beef you are still going to find something here.  I ordered the Hubert Keller burger that was buffalo meat with caramelized onions, baby spinach and bleu cheese on a ciabatta with red wine and shallots sauce.  If it is good enough for Hubert it is good enough for me.  The burger was perfectly medium rare and the entire thing was messy and dripping with savory juices from the sauce and the caramelized onions. It was delicious...and huge!  I didn't finish the entire thing but that may have been because I stuffed my face with fries.  The BF got the lamb burger.  This one is with secret spices, tomato, cilantro, and spicy burger bar ketchup.  It had a great spice taste, like Middle Eastern inspired flavor.  And the spicy ketchup - that is the stuff.  We ordered a separate order of that for our fries.  Not that the fries needed ketchup but damn that ketchup was good.  I cannot stress enough how good those fries were.  I am a huge fan of skinny fries, crunchier the better, and dear God they were amazing.    If you don't want burgers, they do have salads and a chicken sandwich too.  They also have milkshakes, including BOOZY milkshakes.  If ONLY I had enough room for one of those too.    Service was good, our waitress was attentive and didn't let us go thirsty.  She also answered that Chef Keller was not there that weekend and told me I could keep up with his whereabouts (i.e. stalk him more effectively) on facebook.  She confirmed that he is a sweet guy just like I already knew.  The prices are pretty standard Vegas if you ask me which means it isn't gonna be the cheapest burger...mine was $22 if that tells you.  And the ketchup extra was $1.  But hey, that's how it goes.  Next time you are in Vegas and want a casual atmosphere and a damn fine burger and the best fries EVER you need to come here.
374	1	I love everything about this place. It stands for something, a voice of truth, reason, and simplicity in a city built on ostentatious complexity and because of this, I can say with complete confidence that there is not a better meal in Las Vegas.   So rare it is to find a great meal and an unbelievable price for Las Vegas that I would choose a meal at the Pizzeria over any other place in town. I mean it. Here you will not find a line for gamblers who have been given complementary dining and line passes, you will not need a reservation, and you will not find a dress code.   What you will find inside this hallway is truth. People who seem genuinely happy you came in to grab a slice. You will find real pizza. Unharmed by some celebrity chef being paid too much to make expensive food that is rarely worth the cost.   Your food is served on a cheap paper plate, your beer is served in a red plastic college party cup. Have a seat on one of the three barstools, play some pinball, watch some sports and soak it in because when you exit through that hallway, you will not find another real restaurant on the Strip until you return.
1612	0	I already don't like buffets so when I came here after having to wait in line for 40 mins I was seriously disappointed. Most of the food was just standard fare with some of the Middle Eastern stuff being interesting. Unlike the Bellagio where I ate until I felt like my stomach would pop I ate very sparingly here.  The only memorable thing that happened here was my friend telling me that he wanted me to go with him to the 24 hr marriage chapel to be the witness (and take pics) so he could get hitched with his girl that nite..  while I was trying to get some lamb chops..  it seemed kinda surreal at the moment.
79	1	The service was awesome; very fast, helpful, cheerful, and polite! And the food was absolutely delicious. I visited this place twice during one visit to Vegas bc I couldnt get enough of it :) My favorite was the Drunken Sea Bass, Red Curry, pork larb, and the mint duck... all reasonably priced. I know thai food and this is it, yum.
424	1	This was my first time to this establishment .. I have to say that I really enjoyed myself.  The food was great, the portions are huge though.  The have a full bar, so you can have a mimosa for brunch or even an afternoon cocktail.  I will def. be back !
1945	0	OK, i never write reviews this long, but it has to be done...  The ONLY reason I stayed at Hooters was because it is right across the street from the MGM where I was attending a hockey game last weekend. Trust me, pay the extra $$ to stay somewhere else!! Somewhere that doesn't have stains all over the carpet, a tub that drains or cigarette burns in the duvet cover!    The girl who checked us in was not very friendly, but the girl who checked us out was.. so it's hit or miss with the staff. Also, I thought Hooters girls were supposed to be hot?? Guess it's slim pickens in Vegas, all the hot girls are working at the Wynn I suppose.  Also, pieces of the laminate hardwood floors in the lobby and hallways are all broken up or cracked and I stubbed my toe really hard on a piece where the shitty floor meets the nasty ass casino carpet. OW! goddamn piece of shit Hooters!!  The elevators are rickety and scary sounding just as other people's reviews say, it's no lie.  The pool is tiny and the towels they give you are an absolute joke! They look like the towels they use to wipe down the bar with! and they are TINY! I'm an average size chick, I had to use 3 towels just to equal ONE normal size towel, also there are black stains all over them like some was just cleaning a car with them EEWW!!  I'm a vegetarian, so we ate one night at the restaurant "The Mad Onion" in the hotel.. grooooossss.  MAYBE the ONLY good thing would be the $1.50 beers at the bar.. but i always bring my own alcohol to Vegas so it didn't matter much to me.
136	1	Tropical cocktails in colored pictures and in massive glass globes, pink neons lights cast strange shadows on the faux foliage, gilded mirrors makes the room look like a ballroom while the cocktail servers, clad in floor-length ball gowns and soft sex voices, sashay around the bubbling fire pit.   Strange place. But yes, I still take every one of my out-of-town friends here. Every single one.
714	0	This review is for the casino only, and after hanging out there for a couple hours, I probably would not consider getting a room here, even if it was free. I'm the kind of person that doesn't mind paying a little more for service, or at least some personality.   I dropped my money off at the blackjack tables, and the roullete table, and of the six or seven different dealers that ran them, NOT ONE was polite, funny or even smiling. If you're gonna take my money, at least give me a smile. Smiles are free at McDonalds, and they have a dollar menu. The last table I played, the Roullete dealer barked at me for picking up my chips too soon, and gave me a look that made me want to knock his nose in. The waitress that was taking drinks at first did not want to give me a drink because I wasn't seated, and when I showed her my stack of chips on the table, she rolled her eyes back and said, "well whadda ya want then?" Don't these people work on tips? Yeah, stay the hell away from this place.
1705	1	this was a mind-numbingly good meal.  It's rare to see a restaurant be innovative with breakfast--rare to see them break out of the eggs-1000-different-ways mentality. But Hash House does so, and succeeds.  They have a wide variety of unique breakfast fare, as well as traditional fare stepped-up a notch in quality.  The portions are absurdly large, which is probably why the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict was featured on Man Vs. Food. The pancakes are superb, as was the Sage Benny which is bacon, fried chicken and eggs atop a biscuit atop mashed potatoes, all smothered in a chipotle cream sauce.  Additionally, the cast of Pawn Stars was seated next to us. But expect a wait for a table, this place is hopping.
1114	1	What and Amazing Experience! The food was flavorful, freshly prepared, and spot on! What an amazing wine list - my friend is a Sommelier - was mesmerized by the variety and affordable price point. The only thing that I have to say negative is that the service is not nearly as OUTSTANDING as the food!
639	0	Within 60 minutes of eating at the Aria Buffet two members of our dinning party came down with food poisoning. we ate dinner at 6:00 PM and had only had plain bagels for breakfast that morning. Both members of our party were ill for the remainder of the trip and stayed in their hotel rooms. When we called early  the next morning to ask if others had become ill we were told nobody had called and they served over 2,000 people and there was no way we became ill from eating there. We don't know if others called after we did. But seemed odd that the "manager" could be sure that we did not get sick from eating there. He told me to call security and file a report. I asked him what good that would do my wife and he said he did not know but that was what we needed to do. No apology, no empathy. Keep in mind we paid $75 (per couple) for this meal and one would expect better than this.  As a result we will never set foot in another MGM property again. The situation was handled poorly.
1973	0	ASSHOLES...WOULDN'T ACCEPT A REAL DRIVERS LICENSE... Tall skinny D-bag bouncer wouldn't let me and my 3 girlfriends in because he thought my real AZ drivers license was fake. I'm 27 and we were even on the guest list!! He wouldn't tell me why he wouldn't accept it, just said nope you gotta leave. I've never in my life had a problem with my ID. I asked to talk to the manager and he claimed he was the manager. Yeah right, what managers gets stuck working the line?!! I suggest they actually train their bouncers on how to examine IDs and not to be douche bags! I'm sure this place is wayyyyyy overrated anyways!
496	1	Las Vegas is my hometown and I am there a few times a year to visit family. Bachi Burger was built during my last year in Vegas before I moved to Boston literally two minutes away from my house.  Bachi has the best burgers I have ever tasted in my life. Hands down. I cannot find the words to describe them. I could search the volumes of Poe and Emerson and Twain and even their brilliance combined could not do poetic justice to this burger.  I have since adopted a vegetarian lifestyle and this burger is one of the few meats I miss eating. I still insist on going to Bachi Burger every time I am home for a visit. Their salt and pepper fries (with huge chunks of garlic and jalapeno) and garlic aioli are delicious and I love to snack on them.  If you like burgers, go have a bachi burger. If you don't like burgers, go anyway. It'll make you like burgers.   Oh, and my favorite Bachi memory? I took my boyfriend there for the first time for lunch. He and I were still hanging out at 7 pm and I asked where he wanted to go for dinner. At his request we went back to Bachi Burger.   While waiting to be seated a man walked in and asked us if we'd ever eaten there before. My boyfriend's response was, "Yeah, for lunch." The guy told us he had initially been at a restaurant down the street and asked the hostess there if Bachi was any good. She told him it was ok, but he decided to take our word for it.
1187	0	A little bit of a let down:( the sweet potato fries were cold and had to be sent back. The chicken wings were also cold...the chili was good. The frozen hot chocolate was good but nothing to rave about. Service was nice and friendly  - nice location and atmosphere... However probably won't go back again. Very disappointed
1201	1	With over 2,000 reviews and nearly 5 star rating, I'm not sure there's much more I could say that hasn't already been stated by others but I tell you what, this place is truly worthy of the raves and ratings.   Located about two miles passed Palace Station casino off Sahara Ave, The Egg & I is a wonderful breakfast/brunch place that is continuously packed. The service is quick, efficient and friendly. Our server Perry was right there ready to take our orders and food arrived shortly afterwards.   We had the prime rib benny, grandma's biscuits and gravy, corned beef hash and Island Favorite. Everything was delicious but I found the benny to be a bit salty for my preference....the banana nut muffin was sooo good and moist. I highly recommend this place and will be back here the next time I come to Vegas.
1245	1	Sad fact: I've lived in Vegas for over seven years, and it's only recently that I had a chance to eat here. Sad, I know, but with the Riviera closing recently, the lure of "Old Vegas" got me in the mood to try more classics.  Worth the wait.  The place scream '80's neon decor. It's a lively atmosphere with music videos on the TVs. Without a doubt, the vibe of the place was the biggest appeal to me here. I tried one of their benedicts, and the flavor had me charging through my meal (it can be said in my defense that I was very hungry that night). Again, I sampled their Bloody Mary, and that was "Yes" and "Please".  I did not, however, sample their Fireside Lounge this outing, but I did go in to check it out. I love their fire pit. It's really impressive, and now I have to find an excuse to go dress up and experience it proper.  This is a classic restaurant. My only regret is not visiting it sooner now that I've been able to experience its food and appeal. While I have grumbled in the past that Vegas doesn't respect its history, I hope they have the smarts to leave this landmark location alone, and let it continue to do its thing.  I can see this becoming one of my new favorites.
629	0	The price is way too high for the food. The food is decent but you can find the same food on Spring Mountain road for 1/3 the price. I had the Shichuan Dan Dan Mein and Stir-fry Lamb with Cumin. Both were ok. The portions were on the small side. The service is zombie-like and the decor is plasticky. Not recommended.
1145	0	The food is subpar here. The Rio is way better. I came here because it's part of the Buffet of Buffets.  Go for the Cotton candy and pre-sliced crab legs. The chinese and indian stations looked very sad. I made myself fancy salads with chilled shrimp and snow crab legs.  The crepe station makes sweets only. It's really greasy compared to the Paris buffet.  It's a pretty small buffet.
1151	1	the best thai food in las vegas!   you would never guess that the best thai food in vegas is in some nondescript crappy strip mall a few miles off the strip but it is.  be prepared to wait...I dont know that they do reservations but its worth it.  the food is excellent and is quite reasonable especially when you compare it to comparable quality restaurants in the major casinos!
567	0	My beef isn't so much the  actual taste of the food it's more like the portion and cost.  I know, I know after all this is Las Vegas so everything is priced three times what it usually should cost. It is completely beyond me how people can charge this much for food. During this particular visit I arrived with seven other guests three of which were menly men (like these boys could eat). One of them even asked which is your largest meal and the waiter responded with Twenty Vegetable Fried Rice. Judging by it's miniture size I doubt it actually had twenty vegetables it was probably named that cause it cost close to twenty dollars!   Next up is the Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich it is braised red pork in a chinese flat bread. It was tasty but a bit on the salty side and was almost half the size of my iphone!   Then my hunny and I split the Shrimp Mojo per the waiter's recommendation. It was packed full or flavor and mouthwatering good. It was $16 for eight pieces.  Again my complaint isn't towards the taste or quality of the food mainly the portions. The service was good we were seated within 10 minutes for a party of eight while other places had hour long wait times. The restaurant decor and arrangement was very chic and trendy. But after loosing my butt in the casino I doubt I'd be able to pay for a substantial lunch here!
897	0	No.  Obviously you don't have very high expectations when going to a place like this.. it's basically a glorified bar.. and this location is on the Las Vegas Strip...and to basically mimic what another reviewer said: the service was sloooow - and the food was GROSS.   I ordered a 'chicken fajita burrito'.. which came to he table as a 'BEEF fajita burrito'.. about 35 minutes after it was ordered..AND it had CHILI all over it... like beef chili.. slopped over the top.. along with fake canned cheese.. which I guess would be fine, if that is what I had ordered.. and i was extremely drunk.  It was incorrect.. it looked unappealing.. but hey, I gave it a chance. Sufficed to say, I won't be going back for that particular menu item. (I did mention to the server that it was incorrect... he claimed they sent the wrong one, and I said I would deal with it.. but on the bill, it was listed as BEEF Fajita Burrito..as in.. he ordered the wrong item and lied to me about it.) Mistakes happen.. I get it... I'm just sayin.  The 2 friends I was with, both decided it was pretty bad service as there were missing utensils, drinks for the 3 of us were coming one at a time.. and there really seemed to be no excuse for the lack in service, because they were not at all busy.   We all agreed that the drinks weren't bad.. and the outdoor patio is a nice attraction to ''people watch' from .. but other than that.. I will not be eating any of their "signature" dishes again...ever. They had chicken tenders with fries on the menu, and if I ever visit this spot again to have drinks.. and decide that I am hungry (and very lazy, because there are 10 better choices less than 50 feet away, ) I will be having those.   I don't recommend the food at all. The drinks were good and the Jeremiah Sweet Tea Vodka(?) Drink.. was tasty albeit very  sweet... but I did have 2! Anyway.. that's that.. good luck in your dining adventures!
1522	1	In Vegas, every restaurant claims some sort of award. Holsteins is one of them, and deservedly so. Banana Foster milkshake was super good. Steakhouse Burger was perfectly done and absolutely delicious. Sweet potato fries also crispy and sweet, fabulous onion rings. Decor is awesome with hilarious pictures of their cow logo. Jordan was our server and she helpful and friendly (and cute). High recommendation in a city with many overpriced sub-par burgers.
929	0	I've been to other Brazilian places: Texas de Brazil, Fogo de Chao, Via Brazil. All on several occasions. This place is not comparable with the quality of food, dining experience or service.... But it does cost just as much.   The salad bar wasn't up to par because the selection isn't as wide as Texas de Brazil or Fogo de Chao. The cheeses weren't as good, nor the cold meats.   The meats brought around weren't cooked well. The selection of meats was mostly cheap pork or chicken, and I found them fatty. The sirloin, when it finally came, was tough.  Don't pay extra for the seafood. It's basically a plate of crab cakes and tilapia (decent enough) with some unshelled shrimp. Really? Unshelled shrimp?  If you're local just stay off the strip and go to one of the other places. If you're a tourist, it's worth the trip to towne square for Texas de Brazil.
1552	0	Went back and found that the best server who helped us last time, JT, was no longer with the company.  BOOO on Cabo Wabo Cantina.  Forget it, this place does not have the right attitude since JT was a real Sammy fan and actually was really fun and interesting to talk to.
265	0	NOT A HILTON ANYMORE ! Do not stay at this property. They have been kicked out of the Hilton Brand for poor performance. I had such a bad experience at this hotel that I have been keeping an eye on it. If you call the Honors Desk they will explain the situation. They deserve it too. Save your money and go stay somewhere else or you will be sorry. It is nice to see that Hilton corporate cares about its brand and gave this dump the axe. Thank you Hilton Corporate.
272	0	what?!?!? really it is the hilton!!!! so many things went wrong! first we originally booked a king gave us a double... then they switched us out the next day only to have a clogged tub!!! then the room they switched us out.. people were still occupying it!! so the last room they gave us.. sink didn't work, tub was dripping really badly, and the phone didn't work!!! by then we were way exhausted to change rooms!!! the hallways were dirty! the rooms were dusty!!! etc!!! WE HATED IT!
1098	0	I only ate here because it came free with our room (and with unlimited drinks at the west wing bar...woohoo!)   I agree with lots of others here, its not the best but not the worst either...but definitely not worth the money they ask for.  If you get this place comped or free, then COOL! You can never go wrong with omelets and bacon for breakfast or mashed potatoes and fried chicken and salads for dinner.  Don't expect much from this buffet and don't pay full price either. Studio B buffet is half the cost and WAY better.   Pros: -Convenient if you're staying at the hotel and can get comped for it, you'll be seated quicker -Has solid buffet basics:fresh green salads and veggies, potatoes and chicken...if you don't go fancy you'll be okay.  Cons: -The "fancier" items looked really suspect to me.  -Super busy and kinda nuts in there. Didn't really like the traffic in and around this buffet.
646	1	First time trying Korean bbq and it was really good. A little pricey, but you get a lot of food. We had a group of 6 and were fine with a meat lover combo for 2 ($55.95) and a couple other sides. The wait staff was very attentive and patient considering we took awhile to figure out what we wanted.
528	0	Eek.   Went to this buffet two days in a row during a trip in Vegas. It drips with mediocrity. You'll notice they have SO MANY choices but none of them are executed well.  This buffet leaves you with a full belly but little satisfaction.  The mini donuts were fab. 2 stars.
234	0	I visited serendipity 3 during Christmas week with my family and we expected to wait a long wait to be seated. But as went up to the hostess she greeted us horribly and in an awfully rude way she told us it would be a 45 min wait, and asked us for our phone number so she would text is when there was an opening available. She never texted us to let us know. When the next family behind us went to make their reservation the hostess greeted them in a nicely manner. After we decided to order from their outside stand, we ordered vanilla and the lady told us she ran out of vanilla but the next guy behind ordered vanilla and she gave it to him. She was also very rude about not having vanilla. We were visiting the Bay Area, California and that is all I wanted a nice experience at Serendipity like john cusack had on serendipity but no that did not happen and my first time experience at serendipity was ruined.
76	1	I don't eat much Thai food.. came here purely because of the hype from online reviews, and realizing I've never been to a Thai restaurant with such acclaim.  Plus this was one of the few times I had a rental car available when visiting Vegas.  Fresh and marinated raw prawns with chili paste.. what a great and unique dish. The serving came with 8 large shrimp that I shared with dining companions, but I could have polished off a plate of these.  I also loved the crispy fried duck served with a congac based curry.  Again, another unique dish to me and I couldn't get enough.  We had other dishes that I can't complain about, but these two were clearly the standouts.   One thing I would mention, the spice level was not nearly as high as I assumed. We ordered "medium" and my next go round i would go high as I felt there wasn't much heat at all. That didn't take away from the fact that I really enjoyed my meal here.   Prices are very reasonable for what you get. This is a very good choice to take a break from the flashy casino dining.
1517	1	This place is awesome! If you come to Vegas, it's a must visit. So juicy and amazingly delicious. You won't be disappointed.  Prices are very reasonable and service is friendly and welcoming. This isn't a date place, it's a-"eat a good burger and grab a beer" kinda place. I can't wait to go back.
1838	1	It is not a secret anymore!!! So sad!! This place is open until 5am, and that is a beautiful thing! The pizza is reasonably priced considering that it's Las Vegas, and it's a NY size slice. It is PERFECT for a late night snack after Marquee.  Go find it! Good luck! There is no signage!
1415	0	My party of 3 waited about 15 minutes before we were seated on the patio on a Friday evening. We ordered a large pot of tea, Frozen Hot Chocolate, and Bread pudding to share. From my point of view, I noticed that this location is not well kept. You can definitely see the wear/tear of the restaurant. It felt dirty out on the patio and I would have preferred to be seated inside, as I noticed random patrons taking seats in the patio area. The desserts came 15 minutes later and we noticed that the bread pudding probably sat in the window for a while. That is, our topping of ice cream was completely melted by the time it reached the table.  Service was non-exisitent as well as the waiter hardly came by to check on us.   Overall, I was let down by Serendipity. The dessert are overpriced and I felt that slow service attributed my poor experience. Perhaps, the New York location may be able to redeem my perception of this chain someday.
616	1	Great restaurant.We came for dinner,about 10 minutes before it opened,and there was already a long queue there.  The food is good,we ordered garlic prawns,green curry with beef,fried sea bass with sweet and sour sauce.I highly recommend the green curry,always my favorite.
1090	1	I will have to say this place has provided me the best steakhouse experience ever.  First thing you notice about this place is that the picture of the chef is not plastered all over the walls which is a great thing.  Let start will the bread that is given, 3 distance tasting breads with a butter that is quite a one of the kind taste.  Beef Wellington is incredible due to the fact that is it so flavorful inside the pastry it is cooked in.  Of course the sticky toffee pudding is really something that has be ordered.  It is really a dessert that you cannot find anywhere else.
1894	0	I don't understand why so many people go to this place... about 18.50 for 2 Saturday breakfast..without drinks    the food is worse than the nearest hometown buffet (half mile away)  i mean food is not THAT bad...is edible but...18.50 for 2 ...breakfast ?  this thing feel like one of those 4.99 buffets in las vegas    I don't understand......every buffet I went to is better than this s..t
1244	1	just great freaking pizza! i am from nj and ny and I know pizza. i don't even particularly care for sicilian and theirs is great. They make their own sausage and meatballs. The best pizzas we have had were the meatlovers, the large pepperoni and mushroom, and the CORNER slices of the white sicilain with sausage , peppers and onions. Absolutely heaven no matter what time of day you go. only complaint is that a soda is 4$. its a fountain soda. we got smart and like a nj pizzaria, we bring a 2 liter and sit on the couches outside. so good so damn good! id put it up against L&B spumoni gardens in Brooklyn and Benny Tudinos in Hoboken. has pinball and leaves the par cheese out for you to use.
231	1	I was in joy when seeing the sign while wandering around with the bf.  we're seated immediately at the comfortable table. As usual, I did the ordering, and my eyes are always bigger than my stomach.  We had chicken and waffles which was something different to try, but tasty,  steak sandwich - very good, fried calamari with rock shrimp - an excellent dish, salad & soup combo which was nothing special, we didnt  even finish half of it. However, each portion was way bigger than I thought. For the drink, my bf had beer, while I got orange & strawberry smoothie in a big glass was super good that I kept drinking instead of eating food, but still couldnt finish, therefore I had to ask my bf to suck it up 'cause I didnt want to waste it.  I love the service here, my waiter was nice, friendly & attentive, he came by few times to ask if everything was ok, and another gentleman which I guessed its the manager came over to check on us making sure we're well served. With an awesome service & food like this, I would love to come any time.
1632	0	Their attitude is so rude, make sure you don't go to this club if you are Asian! I wear according to the dress code with a dress-like shoes. They kicked my group out because of one pair of fking shoes with a very rude attitude. The other white group got in with sneakers. Like WTF!!! Make sure you never book for Tao if you want to have fun in Vegas.
936	0	I'm such an idiot. I didn't check Yelp before I went in. I'm Yelp elite for chrissakes - I check Yelp for everything.  If you're reading this, congratulations. You're making good use of this invaluable public resource. Now you can avoid my experience of spending like $150 on a dinner that was the equivalent of a Howard Johnson's.  How can anyone make pizza taste bad? And how can even the soft serve ice cream suck - how is that even possible??? Apparently, it is. Take my word for it.
1100	1	The wait was like an hour long. This place was packed. The good thing about it was that they'll text you when your table is ready. So you can walk around the Miracle Mile shops until your table is ready.  After finally getting a seat, I really liked the design of the place. The tables were all set up really nicely (the two seaters all in the middle). Gordon Ramsey's picture on the wall though was kind of over the top (at least that's what I thought). No need to promote yourself, we're already in your restaurant. Promote the food.  I don't remember what burger I got, but it was pretty good. I remember I kept thinking so that's what a "gourmet" burger looks like and taste like. It was a bit pricey but not too much. We also ordered fries. Please note you can order 1 fries for 2 people as 1 order will be enough. It comes with 2 dipping sauces I believe.  When I'm in Vegas and I'm not eating at one of the buffets, I'd probably come eat here again.
1607	1	Delicious!   This pizza is great! Light crust, slightly spicy sausage, yummy pepperoni and just enough grease.   Yes, the line is long but does move quickly. For the price, it is almost worth buying a whole box and saving some for the next day. You can call in your order, which helps you skip the line!   A definite must for anyone who has had *too* much fun at Marquee.
738	1	Words cannot describe what my mouth tastes  hahaha but seriously I would definitely recommend coming here anytime, if you are coming back or coming here for the first time. It was really good and different than other burger places like in and out. The bun is really soft and the quantity and size of the burger is perfect; enough to be full along with fries and a shake! I also bought the caramel shake and it tasted really good! It's not too sweet and not too dull so I really enjoyed it! I don't know if the Shake Shack here tastes like the Shake Shack from New York, but it's really good and I would come back! Like I said, I would highly recommend coming here for burgers, fries, shakes, and/or hot dogs! Great job!
96	1	Ever since Triple D came to this restaurant, I had been dying to go. Now that I have gone...IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT!!!  -Oxtail chili cheese fries are excellent. The flavor is outrageous with all the different asian infused spices they use. -The ronin burger was great. It was juicy and worth the money.  Would I go back...HELL YEAH!!
1864	0	Guy with the microphone and mohawk was a complete jerk!  Girls were dancing on stage and a friend of mine went up to join.  He told her "get the F* off the stage now or I'll F*ing throw you off".  Since when is it okay  to cuss and be rude to customers?  There were people up on the stage the whole nigh.  Not sure what the big deal was but he could have just asked her.    Rest of the staff was super friendly and great!
1672	1	Delicious!! We watch Gordon Ramsay's shows and were excited to try his food. The shake my husband had was incredible, an Oreo shake topped with creme brle pudding! We went around 12 on a weekday and had a very short wait. Great service, food came quickly. I recommend the shake #4, roasted jalapeo poppers, southern yardbird burger, and Hell's Kitchen burger. I didn't love the fries but everything else exceeded my expectations!
411	1	$5.50 for a slice is about expected, Vegas (esp the Cosmo!!) definitely isn't a cheap place to eat, but the crust was nicely made and it definitely hit the spot. $17~ for two slices and two bottles of water, but there was no line when we showed up and the pizza was very good!
1137	0	Tao is incredibly overstuffed with pompous people. The main dance floor is far too busy to enjoy yourself. You begin sifting through bodies of people and realize that it's not worth it the effort.  I've been to other nightclubs on the Strip and I was looking forward to this place considering the hype. I was left with a boring experience.  Big frills, few thrills.
364	1	Delicious! I don't eat bread and they were very accommodating. Had chicken burger in lettuce instead of a bun with sweet potato fries and each to dip. So good! They sell pear cider too which is a big win for me :)   I will visit again and recommend highly.
1801	1	Waited about an hour, and I say it was worth it.  We did have a party of 7, so it took longer for us to get seated.  We started off with the oxtail chili cheese fries which were really good, and the fried egg on top was the kicker.  I got the Miyagi burger, and a couple other people got the crabby patty.  Burgers and service were good.  Will definitely come back when we are in vegas again.
1403	0	Had  Christmas dinner at the MGM Buffet.  Wanted to go to Bellagio but the wait was more than 2 hours-- same at Wicked Spoon.  There was no wait at MGM which should have been a hint that the Yelp reviews I had read were accurate.  But we were  determined to go to a buffet to please all the various desires of our group and we had run out of time to find a place that did not require a long wait.   Food was what you would find in a cafeteria and the setting reminded me of eating in a hospital cafe.  Certainly not worth the $40 per person.     Asked for a wine list and was given a little piece of paper with a few wines listed but told the prices were not correct -- we were told the prices  were higher than what was listed but wait person did not know the prices.  Other than not knowing prices for wine, our wait person was very helpful.    I should have  paid attention to the Yelp reviews --I will from now on!!
1516	0	The absolute worse breakfast I've ever been served. Greasy hash browns, gross pancakes that tasted like they forgot to mix the bisquick batter and the most bitter cup of coffee I've ever had. All for the low price of $25, what a joke. Also I could not get the waitresses attention and she didn't come back to my table for 20 minutes. When I told her I almost did a spit take when I tasted the coffee. She took the cup and came back 10 minutes later with the same bitter brew. If you want bad food and bad service this is the place for you. I can't believe food this awful would be allowed in Mandalay Bay. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!
1830	1	Well let's start with the service. Tamara was our server and we would like to give her 10 stars. The biscuits and eggs were also a 10. They have so many people working everything is do smooth. Packed house but a short wait. Best breakfast place in Vegas. We will be back!
429	0	This is for breakfast only.  I have to agree with Jax P.  Bland and soggy were the key words.  Service was subpar.  I asked for coffee, but nearly had to hunt down the server for cream.  There were a ton of bagels out, but no toaster or cream cheese.  The fruit was not ripe, the smoked salmon could have been much more flavorful, the sweets were completely unappealing and the cooked dishes were greasy.  The two roasted meats were the best things there.    The best part?  My stomach ached for hours after eating a small meal here.
215	0	Screw Planet Dailies....  My experience??? Horrible and all the people with me would really agree...  We came in really late...ok I get it but this is Vegas and there was no one else in there so there really was no need for us to wait a half an hour to get some water...that is just horrible service. Then the food took ages...Seriously a sandwhich and some ramen does not take that long to prepare...The food is mediocre at best and the service is just horrible. Perhaps it is better during the day but I wouldn't know just dont ever go after clubbing or bar hopping you will likely die of hunger and thirst before your waitress takes your drink order.  Despite the bad service we tipped well considering the time...but I will not go back.
896	0	This place sucks!  Ordered some beers at the bar waiting on a table to open outside, bartender was rude.  Get outside, waiter ok, but guy who brought our food was rude when he threw it on the table.  Waiter never came back to check on us after the food was ordered!  Love this place in the Bahamas but not in Las Vegas... No fun here! Stick to Senor Frogs in the Caribbean ...
1438	1	My husband and I came here on our last day in Las Vegas, and had been waiting since we planned our wedding and seen them featured on Triple D. We ordered the Oxtail Fries which are absolute heaven. Only need to caution they come loaded with jalapenos, and my husband isn't extremely fond of them ( i love them) and accidentally ingested a few pieces since they were covered by the delicious melty cheese gooeyness and chili cheese oxtail mixture. Not greasy, well balanced appetizer, wish there was one here in FL!. We ordered a burger each, he ordered the Kikki and I got the Miyagi. Both medium, served pink in the center, but not raw or bleeding, perfectly cooked. Meat still had the grilled taste, wasn't over seasoned, over all the burgers were well made. Definately favorite part was the fries, I was sad I didn't have room to try those yummy milkshakes listed, maybe next time!
81	0	Great location, atmosphere and service. But the food, the food. The food is the rub. Every meat was overcooked and dry. It's a steakhouse and I expected the signature food to be much better.  Be sure to get the coupon from the girl out front. But even at half price, it's still no bargain. Maybe try at lunch when prices are already lower.
1967	1	I absolutely looooove this place!!! Everything that I have ate here is absolutely delicious..even the tap water tastes good.   Ive stayed at the Venetian for one of my most recent trips to Vegas for a week..and just about every meal I had was from the Grande Luxe!  What Ive had:  appetizers: Mini chili cheese hot dogs: hit the spot after a night of dancing and drinking at Tao, but dont u dare eat em if u cant hold down ur alcohol and food! Duck pot stickers: very yummy, dont really taste the duck meat due to the spicyness of the Hoisin sauce.  Asian Nachos: such a cool play off regualar nachos. the chips are made from wontons and there is peanut sauce which is spicy and sweet! there is also wasabi cream which is daring but sooo good. This appetizer is good with a beer!  Burgers: The Max Burger: Omfg!! burger effin heaven, I swear to you! Angus beef topped with short ribs, bacon, mushrooms and cheese! So delicious, I wanted to order another..but there was no way I was going to finish it!  Santa Barbara Chicken Sandwich: Delicious, but nothing will top the Max Burger.   Entrees: Jamaican Pork Tenderloin: The presentation is so pretty, you dont want to eat it, but then your senses kick in and you start grubbin! With every bite of the tenderloin top off your fork with a little of the sweet mash potatos and mango salsa..your tongue will thank you! Fried Chicken: An overload of delicious chicken tenders!  Crispy Caramel Chicken: Spicy from the thai sauce, but there is caramel that blands down the kick of the spicyness and makes it a bit sweet.  Chicken Royale: if you want to play it safe, go ahead and pick this. simple and delicious.  Pizza:  Margherita: Yummy with a huge beer! The pizza bread is very thin and super crispy.  Simply put, the food is delicious. Be a risk taker and order something that sounds daring with the fusions of sauces, you wont regret it.  The presentation for all the plates are lovely.  Super Pro: Open 24 hours!!
460	1	Brunch at the Bouchon was WOW. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the Croque Madame (my first bite my eyes opened wide because it was that good). My bf got the chicken and waffles and we both cleaned our plates. Great atmosphere. Sit outside on a nice day and enjoy view of pool and lawn. Come here and treat yourself to a nice breakfast that's not too expensive and delicious! (and yes, I agree with the other reviews that the bread is simply scrumptious)   As for dessert: macarons are located on the lower floor in the Belagio. A must try. I've had macarons at the Napa site as well and they are equally good. Not too sweet as some reviewers mentioned. I personally think they are the best (even compared to SF where I live). As for the Bouchon macarons in Beverly Hills I wasn't impressed with the smaller size or cost. I will let them redeem themselves when the official bakery is opened.
939	1	Ramsay's has become my new favorite steakhouse in Vegas.  The overall surroundings look similar to what it looked like when Les Artiste use to inhabit the location with the exception of a tunnel like hall and a lounge in the bar area where a large table use to exist.  The neon overhang is pretty cool too.  Excellent customer service is offered at Ramsay's.  I've been here twice now on two separate occasions with two different servers and I'm quite impressed.  My only warning for the newly initiated is that you just get plain tap water when they ask you for sparkling or still...$8 a pop otherwise.  On my first visit my table accidentally ordered bottle after bottle thinking the still water was plain water...NOT so.  Five bottles later...oh boy.  We might as well fork out for some more wine.  Great steaks.  The ribeye is my favorite but they have Kobe cuts that will melt in your mouth.  It's much pricier however, as is the caviar.  To save on price, order sides with your dish like the foie gras or bone marrow (no bread to neutralize the oiliness of the marrow however).  The main reason I like this place though is their toffee bread pudding (award winning according to our server)...YOU CANNOT MISS OUT ON THIS!  Save room for dessert.  Oh yeah, their complimentary bread is killer.  If you ask nicely they will pack you a few to go.
1125	1	I've had a lot of Korean BBQ and this place is my favorite. I like how you can cook the meat on your own. This means that no meat gets cold and hard cause you're chowing on something else. Also the smaller portions mean you can try different meats without committing to one type. Servers came by and checked on us often, great service.
1067	1	So there is a reason why everyone raves about the beef wellington,  it is so tender, soft and delicious it is my new favorite food.  I took my husband here for his bday and had one of the best dining experiences. The staff was friendly and very knowledgeable.  The food was phenomenal,  but you do have to like truffle oil to fully enjoy everything.   I would highly recommend this restaurant.
87	0	Ok. When you go to Las Vegas to get the hell away and have to pay for airfare as well. All I can tell you is it's old, worn, but CLEAN! I did feel as if I was stuck in circa 1978 for a few days but hey! It actually worked for the money. It's not fancy and far away from the new part of the strip so I suggest instead of paying for monorail tickets bring or rent a car!
1264	1	Honestly what better way to combat a hangover in Vegas than a cheesy pizza loaded with meats and veggies...hot and ready to order? Yeah, nothing. This review wont be long I swear...because I want you guys to just find this place....on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan...exit out the elevator to your left...then quickly to your right...spot the hallway after the Jaleo Restaurant and make a right down the hallway..... and see the glorious yet tiny SECRET PIZZA place. It's everything your heart desires. Whatever you want, order it- This place is where dreams come true. I was craving a good pizza place, absent of the fancy Vegas pretentiousness and I found it. Made to order. Orgasmic. You gotta do it guys...
377	1	Cents here for breakfast due to a coupon we got for buy 1 get 1. My wife and daughter shared a waffle and egg meal. I had the chile relleno omelet.   We left feeling full and the meals kept us going all day long. We never needed or wanted lunch.  The food was very good. The potatoes were a little salty, but not overly so. The hot sauces they provide added just the right flavor to the omelet.   The waffle looked huge and was crisp despite being topped with strawberries and cream.   Very good value for the money. Well be back next time we're in town.
258	1	I always get the Miyagi-San burger and truffle fries, but the porcini sauce on the fries never seems to be enough and I always have to ask for extra sauce which isn't free. I've also tried their ramen but have just decided to stick with their burgers. I really don't like paying almost 14 bucks for a burger but this is truly worth it and can't eat a regular burger anymore.
1546	1	Boyfriend and I came here on a whim.  It was our first day on our Vegas Vacation, and we came in hungry.  We both love burgers, and we were staying in the Luxor.  As Luxor is connected to Mandalay Bay, Burger bar was close.  Absolutely delicious.  I made my own burger and my boyfriend got the buffalo burger.  We were both blown away.  Serious deliciousness.  The service was also prompt.  We came in for lunch, so I don't know if the dinner crowd and service may be different, but our experience was quick, friendly, and hands down delicious.  We will definitely be back.  YAY for BURGER BAR!!

667	1	My friend recommended coming to this place, and I'm so glad I did! Probably the best Thai food I have ever had. This place is huge, and I can see why! The place immediately became packed as soon as it opened. We had Thai tea, the catfish Po Tek (?) soup, Shrimp Pad Thai, and the famous Garlic Chili Prawns. The Prawns were like $30? But soooo worth it. They were huge and full of flavor! Too bad I'm from Houston; I miss this place already.
1158	1	So much has been said already, so I will be brief.  This is a great restaurant in a casino, yet so far from the casino, you really feel like you're getting away. By every measure, I had a better meal here than I had at Bouchon in Yountville, much to my surprise. Two of us shared what seemed like ten different things, and just about everything worked.  I can't imagine ever returning without having something from the raw bar.  The service was impeccably good.
482	1	You can never go wrong with a good slice of pizza. This place can't even be found easily, but it's pretty popular. I guess it's just living up to its name.   When I first walked in, I wasn't blown away by their choices. But, the simpler the better right? Well for this place it definitely is.  I got a piece of the white sauce pizza. I'm usually kind of grossed out by oily pizza, but this one was awesome. I was trying to eat slow to savor the pizza, but it was so good you just want to inhale it. Quite the predicament, huh?
1445	0	This iconic bigger chain popularized mini slider burgers.  I found them fairly tasteless, skimpy, and unsatisfying.  Going in I had very low expectations of the burgers but even then I was not satisfied with the product.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone and I will definitely not be going back.
1786	1	I'll have to admit that I'm a Thomas Keller fangirl. French Laundry and Per Se were my first two bookmarks on Yelp (#dinnergoals), and I've dined at this particular Bouchon location twice. One of the greatest French cuisine chefs in the world is actually an American who added his own American, playful flair to classic haute cuisine. Reservations are recommended.  I've yet to go for brunch but their dinner is excellent. The ambiance is fun, but intimate. They start off your meal with braided baguettes and butter. My husband and I split the salad lyonnaise and escorgot as our appetizers which were both light and flavorful. I ordered the steak frites because I was feeling basic but the matre d'htel butter on top was heavenly and the steak melted in my mouth (#noragrets). We opted to grab dessert elsewhere but I highly recommend the creme brle here! Service was friendly and attentive.  I look forward to coming back again the next time I'm in Vegas!
1128	1	I stopped in after all the positive reviews, I must say it was right on par. The food was good, banana nut muffin was great, and the staff was awesome! It's actually the great staff that took the 4 star food rating to a 5 star overall diner rating. Thanks guys!
1950	1	Took my best friend here for her pre birthday celebration! We absolutely were addicted to the popcorn appetizer! Whatever they put on it was like popcorn crack and just had a really great punch to it. It definitely was a cheddar mixed with some type of spice we just couldn't put our fingers on it lol   However, we ordered the buffalo wings....super juicy wings with a great buffalo sauce. I'm not typically a buffalo gal but this sauce was on point!My bestie got a chicken burger which she said was not too dry which made her happy, the boy toy got a classic burger and I got a rising sun! The patty was cooked to perfection and was incredibly juicy! The sweet potato fries were just perfect as well. Overall, the food was actually pretty good I have no clue if we went at a good time or what bit everything was cooked to perfection!   I wanted to try a shake but just couldn't do it. I was wayyyyyyy too full, but the popcorn.....yum yum in the tum tum!!! :) Will be back again this time to try a shake with the buns! LOL
1581	0	Average buffet with lots of food options. Because my mother is a platinum member through Total Rewards, we had the steamed crab, which was good. Main issue is that the service was slow. A lot of tables were not cleaned off in a timely manner. Ok buffet, but much better options available.
461	0	I'll give this place 2 stars only because the selection of food was great and what I ate was pretty good. However, the way my friends and I were treated by the staff was horrible. I attended a wedding at the Mandalay Bay and the bride and groom chose to have the guest eat here. The guest and weeding party (about 20 people total) went ahead of the bride and groom to go eat. We were told by the cashier at the front that we would have to pay 18% gratuity even though we were all paying seperatly and not sitting together. All we asked of the staff was to sit in the same general area. The staff told us we would have to pay the tax anyway, why I'm not sure; It's not like we asked them to put tables together or anything. Also, there was hardly anyone in the restaurant at the time.   Because this is where the bride and groom wanted to eat and we didn't want to spoil their special day, we decided to pay separately and what does the staff do.... Intentionally seat everyone all over the restaurant. They didn't even try to seat anyone together.   Finally fed up with what they were doing, we took it upon ourselves to find seats next to each other because the staff was being very unreasonable. As I'm walking, I'm being followed and hounded by a waitress and a supervisor asking me and other people "are you going to pay the 18% tax to sit there"? I thought that was very classless and a very poor example of customer service.   The staffer said if we all sit in the same area, we would be overwhelming the waiter; keep in mind this is a buffet where we get our own food, not a waiter. And more so. After we moved and were seated and eating, the wait staff was seating more people in the same area we moved to. If there were originally worried about overwhelming the waiter, why would they seat more people in that section? Especially when the restaurant still was not even half full?  The food is good, the macaroni bar is really good and the seafood was fresh.
700	1	My 5 stars are for the Rossini burger ALONE, nothing else, not the service or anything else on the menu. Kobe beef, sauted foie gras, shaved truffles, Madeira sauce, on onion bun - are you kidding me? I know to some people it may sound over the top - but it was EXCELLENT. One of the best burgers I have ever had. It is quite pricey, but I would pay that amount of money to taste those flavors again. Unforgettable, indescribable... too much goodness in one burger.  Thank you Chef Keller for creating this tangible dream. (July 2012)
952	1	High quality meat, extremely rich in flavor, great service, & a cute ambience. What more can you ask for? Our server suggested we try the gangnam style BBQ for our first time. From the starters to the dishes, you will not be disappointed! At the end of our meal, we still managed to squeeze in dessert, which was just as good. From the mochi ice cream to the lava cake to honey toast, everything here was on point. Definitely set the standards for Korean BBQ for me.
707	1	This is one of my favorite places to take friends from out of town- I have friends who saw this on Man vs. Food and were dying to try it.  They absolutely loved it, and of course none of us could finish our meals.  I love the chicken and waffles, which is big enough for two people to split and have some left over to take home. My second favorite dish is the grilled cheese with avocado, each slice of bread is close to 2 inches thick, and that's amazing in my book.  The second best thing is the drink menu, which has all sorts of amazing drinks that are basically desserts in their own right- hot chocolate, flavored coffee and cappucinos, etc.  I don't drink alcohol, so it's always nice to see a drink menu with special items that I can actually enjoy.
1642	0	Well, i think i'm one of a hand full of ladies who actually like hooters restaurants.  so my boyfriend took myself and another couple here for my birthday dinner , one of my 4 night stay in vegas (@ treasure island) we also wanted to see there casino.. not that impressed anyway.. The food was okay, the service was awful, of all the hooters i've been to this is the worst by far. And you'd think its be the BEST since its in there hotel/casino.. not the case.
1208	0	Open late for those who are looking for a bite to eat after a rachet night at Marquee but don't go out of your way to come here. It's not a very authentic Chinese restaurant but their Mexican cuisine might be better. We sat for 15 minutes before the server even came by and the restaurant was pretty empty. I tried the fried dumpling which was alright. It was fried like a crab Rangoon, with thick dumpling skin. The swallow a cloud noodle is just Hong Kong style wonton noodle soup. It has egg noodles, bok choy and wontons. The noodles were fine but no taste, the broth was bland, the wontons were mediocre. When pigs fly is a braised pork stuff steamed bun. The filling is sweet but decent. The rou jia mo sandwich is a more traditional dish that I was looking forward to. It's also a braised pork filling in a toasted bun shell but I was Sadly disappointed. The filling was so salty that it didn't even taste good. Not what I was expecting.
946	1	Great food, fast and friendly service. Modern upbeat decor, privatish booths.  Honey bread took over 20 minutes, but was great - order ahead.  Close to the strip, across from the hard rock hotel and Hofbruhaus house (and kiss minigolf).  No frills, would be happy to go back anytime.
1955	0	All i have to say is 1 hour check in. WTF!! The rooms where seemingly old & out dated. For a hotel in Vegas I was expecting a slightly more updated room. Our experience was maybe the worst I have had in any hotel. Again, the checkin was ridiculasly long, and I'm not joking when I said 1 hour!! And this was at 12:15am, on a Tuesday! Then we walked all the way to our room which was about a 10 min walk, with 2 kids mind you. Then we get into our room and just get a wiff of stall cigarette air. We specifically asked for a non smoking of course. So we called the front desk from our nasty room and we were on hold for more than 10 min, after being already frustrated and tired we decided to go to the front desk and go straight to the person and made our statement. We finally got our non smoking room, but also got  very uncomfortable beds. I could go on and on, but let's leave it at that. If you don't believe me just try to experince it yourself and you'll see.   I normally don't write this long of reviews but this 1 just took it! And again, I could go on and on. Bottom line, choose a different hotel if staying in Vegas, The Riviera just didn't cut it.
1869	0	The reviews for this place made me afraid to eat here, and overall this buffet was a let down. It was especially disappointing because even though my visit was free, I would have preferred to totally skip this buffet because it honestly wasn't very good nor was it worth the exorbitant price. It reminded me of a Golden Corral/low end chain restaurant, and definitely not a Las Vegas resort/casino buffet.  The good: The desserts were good. Decent coffee too. Sides like mac & cheese were okay. Chicken tika masala was okay too. Decent flavor profiles to choose from but it was like 85% "American food".  The bad: Almost everything fell short of my already low expectations. The hot crab legs were laughably small, overcooked and fishy. The dude serving up the crab legs seemed like he hated his job and was extremely rude to customers that didnt tip him. They were out of crab crackers and didn't even have wet wipes or cloth napkins available to clean off your hands after hand picking the crab. Most of the steam trays were either empty or filled with food that wasn't fresh. There seemed to be a ton of sloppy, visually unappealing food.   I left feeling disappointed and smelling like rotten seafood. I pretty much ate cookies for dinner. I will definitely not be returning.
915	1	We had a great time celebrating my sister's 40th birthday at Gordon Ramsay Steak.  The wait staff are very professional, attentive and knowledgable. The menu of drinks was impressive, too.  Food was fabulous and  was beautifully presented.  It is a little expensive, but very worth it for special events.
1611	1	I went to Vegas in January.  I ate here the majority of the time.  These burgers were the shit, dude!  Very fresh, and well prepared. I don't quite remember what I got on most of the burger. Can you blame me? My family came to Vegas before this time, and said this place was awesome. They did not lie.
165	1	Slow service so have plenty of time. LOVE the food here. I recommend almond boba, the ronin burger, steamed buns, fish chips, and hot sake. My kind of night! Art on the wall is cool too. This place isn't for everyone. Seating is a little uncomfortable and you can here everyone else's dumb conversations. You also have to have a palate for this stuff. Also, hard to see from the street so keep your eyes peeled.
786	0	I was dragged here for my sisters going away party...that being said it pretty much matched my low expectations and then some.  This place is absolutely disgusting. The dining area is gross, messy and kids were running wild. The plates and silverware were dirty and sticky. The food made me sick. This place deserves no stars.
1397	1	Took my car in today for a smog check.  Was very very pleased with the service.  First, I did not have to even get out of my car and then they brought all the paperwork right to the car for me to sign. The next best thing was it cost only $9.99. Really a great group of people and so friendly.  Will not go anywhere else again for smog check. Thank you all.
1692	0	Beware! We booked on hotwire.com and were told that all expenses had been paid (fees, taxes, etc...); however, three days after our stay we were charged tax for the second time on the credit card we provided for incidentals. When I called to ask them to correct their error, they advised that the refund would be in our account within 5-7 business days. Fair enough, everybody makes mistakes. FYI: IT HAS BEEN 15 BUSINESS DAYS AND NO REFUND. Do they just think you'll forget about the incorrect charge because it is such a small amount (under $50)? PS: We love Westin properties, but this one wasn't too impressive. ------------------------------------- -Located off the Strip -Very Clean -Very Small Rooms (and we were upgraded) -Great for Business, but not for Social Trips -Make Sure to Look Over your Bill when  you Leave. Our Bill Stated that all Expenses were Paid and then they Charged Us!!!
340	0	No bueno. They charge a service fee but service is non existent!! They don't serve you so you have to go get your own drink, our server didn't pick up our plates for a long time and they were piling up so we put them on another table then she noticed and picked them up. We kept doing this during the whole meal.   We brought everything to the manager's attention and she told us they were understaffed and they were doing the best they could!   The food is not tasty and it's all very subpar. Disappointing but they're digging their own grave.
1850	0	WORST PLACE EVER.   I was hungry and wanted a drink and an outdoor place to sit. My boyfriend and I sat down and ordered two margaritas. $12 per. - that isn't the bad part.   Because I was desperate for a snack I ordered the cheapest appetizer on the menu- chips and salsa for $8!   EIGHT DOLLARS! For nachos you would get free anywhere else. And they were so greasy I couldn't eat them. You have to understand I love junky food, but this was SO bad. Just disgusting.   This place gets one star because I HAVE to give it something to rate it.  In all fairness, the server was nice and the location is good (across from the Bellagio fountain) but save your money and buy a 6-pack, some tostitos and sit out on the sidewalk if you want a good view of the show.   Is this what you wanted, Sammy Hagar?
585	1	This is the best burger joint in Vegas. Had the hell's fire burger, sweet potato fries, wings for appetizer and a chocolate shake. Everything tasted fresh. Burger was great size and cooked to perfection. Sweet potato fries were so good and were sprinkled with powdered sugar. Wings were amazing. Service was awesome.  Will definitely come back.
1402	0	Riviera is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in my life. I've traveled around US and Europe and stayed at hotels of different range, but this one stands out the most, sadly for it, in a bad way.   I got a deal on Groupon, and we paid $54 per studio room/day which wasn't a quite usual studio. It was just a room with an empty fridge, non functional TV and toilet, bed bugs, loud conditioner, dirty linens, the most horrible service and most importantly ROBBERY. And i was charged $34 upon my check out (taxes+resort fee per 2 days).  So we checked in at 5 pm and went down to the strip by Monorail, which was quite expensive and within 15 min walk from the hotel.  We got back to the hotel around midnight and found my husband's backpack and my purse stolen from the room. First I couldn't believe it, the reality was too hard to believe. Besides my husband's birthday just started minutes ago after we found his stuff stolen along with his passport. We called the security right away. It took them a while before they finally came to the room and gave us the report sheets. They seemed pretty helpful although they said they are just the third party and hotel risk management will contact us in 5-7 business days from the day of our report. It's been over a month and no one has contacted us, so I decided to do it myself. The risk management "doesn't discuss camera information" and all they said no one has entered our room, according to entry key system. I've got no words to express my disappointment. Do yourself a huge favor and NEVER EVER STAY at this hotel !!!
1533	1	I've been to Bouchon twice now.  The first time was so amazing, I practically planned my next trip to Vegas around my dinner at Bouchon.  While the service left something to be desired on my recent visit, everything else was as exquisite as I remembered it.    Walking into Bouchon I hardly feel like I'm in Vegas.  The dining room is beautiful with big windows and a long metal bar.  It feels like being in Napa, and coming from California, it feels like home (albeit a home much nicer than my own).      On my first visit the service was spot on.  We had at least five people helping us, but they never mixed anything up and it never seemed intrusive.  We also had a four person table for the two of us, which was great since we ordered so much food.  When I went recently, my waiter was very, very slow (both in his service and his speech, which included many, many uncomfortable pauses).  Both times I was particularly impressed by the sommelier, who is adorable, funny, and extremely knowledgeable.        My first trip started with olives, the salmon rillettes, and the goat cheese salad.  I could have done without the salad (it was good, but very simple and too similar to things I make at home), but the olives had a great smoky flavor and the salmon was just fantastic.  I wanted to ask if they would sell me a jar of the salmon to go, but I thought they might be grossed out.  We also ordered a bottle of the sommelier's choice wine--a really fantastic syrah from Oregon.      For our entrees I had the steak frites and the boy had the mussels.  Both of them were amazing, but I preferred my steak to the mussels (and I really love mussels).  They both came with a giant side of frites, which I was honestly a bit disappointed by, given all the raves I'd heard.  There were just too many of them and they seemed slightly undercooked.  Still, that didn't detract from the meal at all.    My second meal started with the salmon (I'd been craving it for months, and it was just as good as I remembered) and the fois gras.  I know fois gras is evil and decadent and I'm suppose to hate it, but my god was this some delicious fois.  The outside was glazed with the most amazing strawberries, which accented the creamy inside perfectly.      For our entrees we had the lamb chops and the scallops.  The lamb had a peppery sauce I wasn't too fond of, but the scallops had another summery fruit sauce that was perfect.       Both times, dessert at Bouchon was good, but not the highlight of the meal for me.  I've had both the chocolate moose and the beignets. The moose was very dark and rich, but I preferred the cream filled beignets.      Small details like the plate of cookies they bring out with your coffee only add to the experience of Bouchon, leaving you entirely satisfied.
25	0	worst place ever... don't ever go.... we decided to take a chance and go in .... looked like a fun place to have breakfast/lunch.... never again... the wait was for 90 minutes even though they said 30 minutes and omg one of the girls in the front needs to get hired.. worst serve ever... she was very rude and people would walk up to her to ask a question and she would just ignore them....  after all that wait the food wasnt even good... just a freaken waste of time... dont waste your time by going in
1447	1	Really great place for breakfast. They have really cute newspaper Menus and give you free banana nut muffins for your first visit! These were the best muffins I've ever had, I'm usually not a fan of banana nut but these blew me away. I also really liked their potatoes, they were crispy and seasoned really well. The bacon and avocado omelette was also to die for! It was our first time there and the waiter was really nice and helpful.
