0	1	Enjoyed the food very much. Reminded me so much of Korea.   Its just like the traditional korean bbq where you cook on the grill in front of you. Ordered the marinated kalbi, bulgogi, duck, and steam egg. Will definitely come back and bring more friends.
1	1	yeah all the hype.  all the fuss.  all the food.  all the shakes.  delicious.  I had the hotdog and chicago dog and they were good.  now the coffee fair trade shake, i could not get enough.oh did I mention the coffee shake was delicious?    If you know what you want, there is a virtually no line window outside to get small things like drinks and cements.
2	1	Secret Pizza is so much fun to take people to!  They do pizza exceptionally well...nice crispy bottom, chewy crust, great sauce.  It is not my all-time-favorite or anything, but on taste alone I'd hand out 4.5 stars.    Any two of the following puts it in a unique place that is well deserved of 5 stars for me:  It is called Secret Pizza for a reason, there are no signs; it is not located on the restaurant listing for the Cosmopolitan. Walking down the hall to a hidden gem is half the fun!  Then there is the fact that you can get a quality IPA on tap.  The wall of records is is incredibly cool, and the black & white tile fits so perfectly.  Pizza + secret + atmosphere + IPA = an easy 5 stars in my book.  I will take out-of-town friends here anytime, but i'd also stop in for a slice if I was anywhere near the cosmo!
3	0	This buffet is crap if you eat here at least once a day, which we did for 5 days during our stay. Lunch is basically leftovers from the previous night's dinner, but guess what, the menu never changes! It's the same stuff every day. However, one day, there was NY Steak straight from the grill, but the price per person shoots up to like $40 (not worth it for just steak and the same stuff). One extra star for the frozen yogurt at the dessert area, which I never got sick of.
4	1	Our server  was breeaanda? She was super nice and helpful. We were  originally sat outside but someone in our party had a fear of birds so they were able to relocate us inside. Our server was attentive and help and friendly. Chili Omelet  was the best!!
5	0	first I must say I liked the salad bar area, because they serve it to you and that cuts back on germs and it was good. However the for the price i was expecting more of a selection in foods. The desert section is great. they have cotton candy. My waitress kept getting our drink orders wrong. Oh, and my coffee was lukewarm.  between my husband and myself the meal cost about $50.  I think it was just to expensive for what you get. I will not return there, i have had better buffet  experiences for a lot less money.
6	1	Recently had friends call to say there were coming to visit and wanted to know if I would like to join them at this restaurant.   Reservations were necessary because this place is in high demand and I certainly realized why once we had our meal.  We were beyond happy!  My friend had heard of this place on the food network (she is from North Carolina).    If you want atmosphere you will not find it here but food unbelievable, smiling faces everywhere and those of us lucky enough to live here get to go back. I had the prawns.  You get them with the shells and believe me the way they are prepared you wonder why other restaurants do not prepare them the same way.  Of course we had starters and shared. Each one impressive.    Keep in mind, if you DO get a reservation do not be tardy. They give your table away after so many minutes! My friend called 2 months before they were to fly out here so of course we got our reservation.  Thanks to Anthony Bourdain for saying Lotus of Siam is THE best Thai food he has ever had in all his travels.  My friends and I are fans of his and that is why they knew where to go when they arrived in Vegas.
7	0	Allergy to onions. Food came out with onions. Waited 15 minutes for drinks. No apology from the server. And she charged us for a side of mushrooms...which we never ordered nor did we receive. Manager said she could "look into it," but we had a flight to catch. I suggest waiting in line for ANY other restaurant before getting sat here right away...chances are you'll wait the same amount anyway.
8	1	The food was great!   Our waitress was very occupied though, because I had to ask another waitress twice to get her.  We ordered the buffalo chicken rolls and they were delicious!  Crisp, hot and very good flavor. Then I got the pasta and salad lunch portion.  My pasta was very good. I ordered the Carbonara. A little too much peas for me, but after I picked a few off the top, it was good.  The salad was a small portion of greens on the side, but was perfect since the appetizer filled me up.  I also ordered a Blanco Sangria and it was just a 3 out of 5.  Drinkable, but wouldn't order again.   I really enjoyed the food, so I am still giving this a 5 regardless of the drink and service.  I will return.
9	0	Ordered Baja fish tacos and the shrimp and pork gyoza. The fish tacos were fine, nothing special one way or the other. The filling inside the gyoza was completely undercooked. As in it looked like the filling was tuna ceviche not cooked pork. Disgusting. They brought a new batch which was properly cooked but didn't even offer to take the charge off the bill. Never coming back. Mediocre at best. I'm just thankful I cut into that dumpling before popping the whole thing in my mouth or I would probably be very sick right now...
10	0	Waited 15 mins only to be seated outdoor when we specifically requested indoor.  Looking around in the restaurant there were plenty of empty seats. Not sure who or what they were expecting... We came for some dessert but our stomachs turned when our desserts arrived - massive portions and sloppy presentation.  The taste and quality of food was mediocre.  They get away with overcharging on this garbage made from cheap ingredients.  As well, the interior decorating and ambience was a disappointment too, certainly far from any "Vegas" standard.    You'd be much happier and satisfied by going to Dairy Queen for dessert.
11	1	They take peanut allergies serious here which is great for our family who has many kids with peanut allergies. Everything we had here was made to perfection - the ox tail fries with fried egg on top,  Ronin burger (my personal fav) and the Shogun (foie gras any one?!).  The burger was cooked to perfect medium rare which made it juicy.  I ate everything on my plate and dug into my god daughter's salt/pepper fries with jalepenos.  OMG, my mouth is watering just thinking about our heavenly meal.
12	0	"You get what you pay for"  If only that were the truth.  Let's see....  We got there and: 1) The elevator from the parking structure is out - so we hoof it from the 4th floor all the way to reception with our bags in tow.    2)We got booked into a smoking room when we specifically asked for a non-smoking room  3)We got transferred to a non-smoking room (after a few hours) with a view of the Airport.... well, there would have been a view if the windows weren't so damned grimy  4)Uncomfortable Bed  5)Tube TV that kept cutting out every few minutes, which wouldn't have been bad on its own, but the batteries on the remote were dead.. HAH!  Okay, at 25 bucks a night, I might have agreed that we got what we paid for and it might have been a So-so 2.5 to three stars.  MAYBE.  But when you tack on an additional UNDISCLOSED $15/day "Resort Fee"  (What resort? it was 40 freakin Degrees out!), No Wi-Fi AND $15/day wired internet fee??  ....  Umm... Yeah ... 1.5 stars and I'm not even going to round it up to two.   PROTIP: Hooters appears to be where failed Import model wannabes with bad boob jobs go to die. - Enjoy.
13	1	It's the best oh my gawd just delicious. We stumbled upon this place on accident. Me being a huge music lover I couldn't help but notice all these record covers on the wall. The next thing I knew we were in pizza heaven. We came here about three times on our 4 day trip and had pepperoni and mushrooms. Just delightful. It was almost identical to NY style pizza. It looked just like Ninja turtle pizza. All melty and delicious and it tasted like a slice of heaven. The pepperoni was thick cut and so tasty.
14	0	When there on Sunday nite with my wife to have late dinner. I have been here before food is ok service was good but this time service was terrible , we sat there for 20 min no one showed up I got up and asked one of the girls in front for help and that didn't help, finally a waiter showed up to say hello and left as fast as he showed up. I say if they were busy Ok but they weren't. That's the last time I'm going to go there and would not recommended anybody to go there.
15	1	Since it's opening, it has become a must-do whenever we are in Vegas. Have tried 3 different burgers, all were amazing. Love the curry and chipotle katsups that come with the thick cut fries. Tried a shake for the first time on our last visit. It tasted delicious, but the pudding on top was an unexpected surprise. Expect a long wait at regular meal times. I always grab a pen at the end-- one more touch I love (twice our waitress brought more pens for us)
16	1	Visiting Las Vegas for the weekend and saw that this place had some pretty great reviews. People weren't kidding, it's FANTASTIC. Our server was Liza and she was SO attentive, kind, and helpful. True definition of a great waitress. Everyone's plate was clean at the end of breakfast. I was very impressed with this place and will definitely seek it out again when I'm back in Vegas.
17	1	This is the best Thai restaurant I have to been to.   Didn't expect the food here to be this amazing. It's located in a run down lot a little outside of the strip. Once you get inside the restaurant you see all tons of wine's behind a glass. A big restaurant clean inside that looks nothing like the horrible outside. Service is really attentive and makes sure your table is always clean.   The food here was superb. Next time I come here I'm only ordering the specialty dishes. The typical dishes are great but they have such an awesome menu that every dish we got blew my mind. The tom yum kai soup is delicious and you can't go wrong with that. The pad thai they use thin noodles which made me like it even more! The sea bass drunken noodles was crack. The fish itself was so tender it was like butter. The green curry was another highligh that felt like eating coconut butter on top of rice. I couldn't get enough of it. The raw beef tar tar was light and fresh. The fried rice was good but probably the least memorable of the dishes. Next time I come here I'm getting the deep fried prawns. If you visit Vegas make sure to stop by this place. You will not be disappointed.  Recommendation: Sea Bass Drunken Noodles, Pad Thai, and Green Curry
18	1	A new Must when visiting Las Vegas!!  The food was absolutely delicious!! And the portions were extremely generous. The staff was very friendly and very attentive. Our server Earl made sure we were well taken care of as well as Carole Ann. Definitely coming back!
19	1	Hash House a Go-Go is our Favorite place to bring family and friends when they are visiting from out of town. Breakfast is served all day and our favorite meal to have there. We love when they order pancakes and the shock on their face when the huge plate arrives. Watermelon lemonade is amazing!   First heard about the restaurant  on the Food Network. Everything tastes home cooked and delicious.
20	1	Bouchon is a strikingly casual yet elegant bistro located in the upper reaches of the Venetian hotel.  How casual?  One of our servers did an extended shimmy to a Prince song, there was constant "inappropriate" banter between ourselves and the wonderful individuals who serviced our tables, and there may have been an impromptu coloring session wherein caricatures of patrons at other tables may have been found serenading around the staff's own contribution - the sexy and i know it duck.  So while the high ceilings and beautiful courtyard might suggest one experience, you certainly aren't limited in that manner.    The unanimous decision of our table is that this is the best service we have ever had.  I should explain that.  The balance between entertaining and professional one finds here is something I had previously not experienced.  One might think that perhaps the staff's antics was a convenient mask shrouding potential issues concerning their knowledge of the menu.  That is simply not the case.  We received incredible guidance concerning wine choices and our server hand-picked an off-menu dessert for us (an incredible vanilla bean creme brulee that one international traveler in our group deemed the best she has ever had... it was in my top five as well).  When I can say that people who worked at the restaurant overshadowed a Thomas Keller production in a positive fashion, it becomes at least subjectively obvious that a new dining experience has been created.    That leads us to the food.  Bouchon is one of those few Vegas restaurants that allows friends with different means to comfortably dine with one another.  You don't have to go high-end (I did anyway); as you can see, most Yelp reviews focus on the cheapest dish, a luxuriously decadent take on the Croque Madame, a dish that is fully less than 1/2 the price of the steak.  I am sure it is incredible, yet I would encourage patrons to purchase the steak Bouchon, a blissful cut of New York strip steak doused in black truffle jus and accompanied with celery and potato boulangere.  It was easily the best steak I have had since I have moved to DC, and frankly, may have been the best strip steak I have ever eaten (and yes, this is coming from a Texas guy).  The portion was generous, absolutely perfectly cut, aromatic from the truffle, and intensely flavorful.  I would strongly suggest pairing the steak with the sauteed spinach (brilliant) and potato puree (very buttery).  While it wasn't paired with the steak, the other dish I really enjoyed was the braised cabbage.  I wasn't as enamored by the mac and cheese here, but that isn't to say that it wasn't a solid preparation.    Given that this restaurant delivered on two of arguably the best experiences of my life (best service and potentially best NY strip steak), it is pretty much a no brainer that I would suggest this restaurant to anyone.
21	1	Im in love. The food here was so delicious. So many things to try. I recomend the sukiyaki noodles and the spicy chicken with lemon sauce. For dessert tey the honey bread. Its so fen good. A bit pricey but its worth it. The staff is so friendly, so nice. A must try if your craving korean bbq.
22	0	Oh my, where to start. This is like the Golden Corral's sad disease ridden cousin who lives under the stairs. When I made it over to the buffet it became apparent why they make you pay before you get into the restaurant. The "hot" meats were dry and only barely warm. The cold items were not really. If you eat seafood from this buffet, you are more brave than I am. After trying a several different things, including the taco chicken, and pizza (because how can you mess that up) I decided that the items on the buffet were all upsettingly distasteful and I would just eat salad. They had an olive salad (i love olives), tomato salad (also love tomato salad) and spinach salad. The Olive Salad actually tasted like garbage smells. The Tomato salad was not much better. The best things on the buffet were actually the enchiladas which tasted like they came from the freezer section at a shady grocery store. With all of the other choices around for food, pass on this one.
23	1	The Cosmopolitan Hotel & Casino has a secret and it's hidden on the third floor!  Take the escalator up to the 3rd floor.  As you exit the escalator, there is a hallway directly in front of you to the left of Jaleo (tapas restaurant).  Follow this hallway until it ends and there you will find some of the best pizza on the Las Vegas strip.  Seriously, I saw people waiting in line for crap pizza outside, when they could have easily come here for pizza that is 100 times better.  Sold by the slice or whole, this small spot offers a variety of pies to choose from.  Although it's primarily a counter, there is a small amount of space to eat at.  If not, just go eat in the lounge area directly outside the hidden hallway.  I ordered two pepperoni slices for $5.25 each.  They had just come out of the oven so they were hot.  The cheese was really good and gooey as was the pepperoni itself.  This is definitely worth a visit if you're in the mood for a few slices of pizza.
24	0	Yeah this place is so unfriendly to guys its not even funny. Granted I was with my family so clubbing was more of an afterthought instead of the main event. We didn't have time to go look for passes or get on the guestlist. We get there around 11:30pm. Yeah yeah sorry for being a tourist first. We wait in line for 25 mins in the general admission line and its 20 bucks each.. Me and 3 girls equals 80 bucks WTF. I think tao doesn't know there's a recession or maybe doesn't care. I should have seen it when they walk 12 girls in and 2 mins later they all walk out. If I was with the guys I would have followed them instead going inside. What are they thinking, hot girls never want to pay cover. I did see some guy get in with the laced vans though.  when we get in its a huge cluster f#*k as usual. No room to dance or do anything. We go and head to the bar. 4 drinks were 67 bucks plus tips. At least the bartenders are fast and courteous. It doesn't matter because the marketing genius behind tao wants to shoot foam into the air everywhere, especially into your drink so you can go buy another. Forget about my $300 blazer.   Oh I wanna give a big F U to one of the bouncers. I had this glowstick with me from a concert I brought into the club. I started ravin' out for kicks. Some hot chick on the 'girls catwalk' sees me and asks for it. I ask the bouncer if I can give to her in person. He goes naw, I can't let you walk through the VIP tables... I give it to the bouncer and he walks it over. She blows me a kiss and walks down from the catwalk. I try to going through crowd to meet up but I never see her again. Thanks Mr. cockblocker, you made my night.
25	0	worst place ever... don't ever go.... we decided to take a chance and go in .... looked like a fun place to have breakfast/lunch.... never again... the wait was for 90 minutes even though they said 30 minutes and omg one of the girls in the front needs to get hired.. worst serve ever... she was very rude and people would walk up to her to ask a question and she would just ignore them....  after all that wait the food wasnt even good... just a freaken waste of time... dont waste your time by going in
26	0	What a dive, the tower rooms made the bottom of my feet black , tub, shower don't drain the tub was dirty, ate at the cafe and the buffet and both the casher was pan handling for vets administration so I ask how much do they get and what does the casino take and what are the administration cost , they wasn't able to answer me. Looked at me like I was a complete asshole for asking? Surprised to see a casino panhandling and if you play the table games it does not put any points on your card for food absolutely zero you have to ask for a supervisor and beg to get them to pay for your food , you can spend thousands there and never get a penny's worth of food. I asked him what was up with that and a box man at the craps table told me they were plenty busy. That was The same as telling me we don't need your business. Dirty rooms bad customer service panhandling restaurant cashiers was too much for me looking for a new different place to stay
27	1	My boyfriend was craving some Kbbq and we wanted to try something new apart from Sura and Tofu Hut. I found this place on Yelp so we decided to try it. I wasnt expecting much since yelp stars cant be trusted sometimes. But OMG just as we walked in..Cute Korean Dudes.. lol. No but seriously, the staff were very accommodating and friendly. The place looked very clean, modern and spacious. We got there around 6pm and the place was packed. We got seated shortly after and Calvin, our waiter was very helpful in deciding what to get. We then ordered their Best Seller: Gangnam for 2, $65.95. We felt that the portions were perfect, mann we were stuffed. Then we had Honey Toast and Lava Cake for dessert..yummy! Apparently if you make a yelp review you get either a Lava Cake or Banana Tempura Ice Cream for free.  Our first time experience at this place was awesome. It just might be our new go-to place. The food, and the staff was great. I definitely would recommend this place. It is on the pricey side, but definitely worth it.
28	1	After just having eaten at Joel Robuchon, I did not have an expectation that this restaurant would blow me away. What surprised me was that it did. The service was great, and it was timely. Our waiter even asked if we had plans for a show so they could expedite our meal. I had read on yelp that the rib cap was the thing to get. Two of us ordered that, so I ordered the less recommended Beef Wellington.  It was soooooo good. Tender and flavorful. The sides of spicy corn and the mac and cheese were delicious too. I'm not sure if these are supposed to be family style. They are only $13 I think, but come in small cups. It wasnt really a problem because we are not glutinous pigs. A couple spoonfuls were sufficient for each of the 4 of us. The bread plate was nice. After Joel Robuchon bread cart, it was not about to blow me away, but since we didn't pay $445, I could understand. We got a magnum of Hirsch Pinot for 295, which was good to the last drop. I was surprised at the coffee which came with the ABC liquor spoons. Yummy! The sticky toffee pudding was delicious as expected. Overall I am leaving Vegas thinking about Beef Wellington.
29	1	This place is ridiculously good. I do not hunk that I've had anything bad here.  The burgers are great, my favs are the spicy miso, and the kalbi. The pork belly and duck buns are great. People really like the oxtail chili fries, but they are not my favorite becaus the chili is too sweet and I can't really taste the oxtail a which I love. Service is always decent, never have a complaint
30	0	They have different sections of food, mexican, american, italian, chinese but not a big selection of each. And the food isnt the best. We went there bc of the unlimited beer, but it was only bud light and some other beer. It was too pricy for the selection if u ask me. $37 for dinner.
31	1	This dining experience did not disappoint!  From the amazing bread, to the famous Beef Wellington for 2!  The service is impeccable, food outstanding, and the atmosphere was beautiful.  The Wellington was tender enough to cut with a fork, and that is not an exaggeration!  We will be back, 5 stars+++, just go and enjoy the experience, you cant get it many places!
32	1	This place is awesome! Fun atmosphere, delicious food, and reasonable price! FYI if you are a Diamond or Seven Stars member of the Ceasars Rewards program they have reserved tables for you and you don't have to wait in line. I tried this the second to last day of my stay and like it so much went back for lunch the next day. The Hummus is amazing, and it comes with pita and assorted veggies to dip.  The veggies are unique, I couldn't really tell exactly what they were but I think I had a baby yellow carrot. It bursted with flavor. We also tried the chicken sliders, they were just the right size. The chicken was perfectly cooked an moist. I usually don't like chicken in restaurants because they over cook it and make it dry. The day prior we had a burger that had some type of chutney on it and we added avocado. Wow!!!! No wonder this place is called BurgR they got it down!!! If you come here make sure you try a burger even if you have to split with someone because you are missing out otherwise. Now both I got the wings as well. They have a unique sauce on them that also goes well with the fries. We ordered extra. Don't worry they aren't too spicy at all in fact the flavor is so unique you will just keep eating them trying to figure out exactly what makes them so delicious. The service here is top notch. The men all wear jeans, and nice clean cut form fitting shirts. And the women had either skirts or pants. It was cute because all wore uniforms but not your typical uniforms. And they sported them like they enjoyed wearing them as well. All the waiters and waitress's appeared to be in athletic shape and well groomed. The service was impeccable and they constantly insured we were well taken care of. I will probably get something here upon every stay now. Delicous! Awesome Job to the Gordon Ramsay Burger Team! You are all doing amazing!!!!
33	0	This place is awful and I can't even believe Caesars palace allows this place to stay in business. When I think of quality I think of Caesars and this was not it.  I have been there before and it wasn't that good so i thought maybe they were having an off day but it seems that's standard operating procedure.  We had the beef brisket noodle soup and it was awful. The beef was 3 chunks of boney fatty I don't even want to call it beef that would be an insult to the cow. The soup was cold! It's a noodle company according to the name and they can't even warm up the soup?!  For $16 I could of eaten an entire smorgasbord in Chinatown for that price. I also had the red bean bun and it was the worst red bean bun I have ever had.  You can go into Chinatown and have dim sum and get the best red bean buns at Orchid Garden.  If I was from Beijing I would be insulted that they were trying to pass this off as something from there.  It was very disappointing.  I guess I'm gonna have to go to Chinatown to get a descent bowl of noodles and hand made red bean buns.
34	0	Horrible.  The food was so chewy and uneatable and the service was so bad.    I mean, our waiter was nice when she was at our table, but she wasn't at the table to often.   We had to always call for her, she would say "yes I'll be right there" then she would walk away and not come to us.   The shrimps and muscles were very fishy and the meat was so chewy like gum.  I did not enjoy my dinner here at all.  One good thing about this place is the olives at the salad bar.  They were very yummy. I'm not the only one who was annoyed.  There was a couple at the other table for 5+ minutes and no one came and took their drink orders.  When they came up to the waitress she had told them "oh we're not serving at that table".     Why would you seat people there if you aren't serving at that table? And mind you, the servers passed by this couple multiple times and didn't tell them anything.  Eventually they moved the couple to a different table.   Anyways, to conclude my thoughts, I will not come here again. Horrible first experience.
35	0	Ummmm totally not worth it!  We wanted to try a different restaurant at our last stay in Vegas. We were originally going to eat Wicked Spoon but the line was long and last call was in 45 minutes. We knew we weren't going to have enough time to eat.   Thankfully, it was only lunch so we weren't TOO HUNGRY so we decided to switch it up and try China Poblano. I first noticed it was owned by chef Jose Andres. I had a bad experience with Chef Andres and truthfully, didn't enjoy his restaurant over in LA at the Bazaar. So I decided to give him another try.  It was pretty empty upon walking in. We were seated promptly and service was fast. First off, we decided to order some soda because we were thirsty and the waitress comes out with these dinky small soda cans!!! Those sodas were $5!!! We orders some ceviche, tacos, dan dan mien, and chilaquiles. My overall favorite was their ceviche. Decent flavor with a good amount of tuna. Nothing spectacular though. Different cuisines are prepared in different kitchens so food comes out at off times. Their noodles were okay. A good kick of spice but obviously not traditional. The chilaquiles was a joke. Basically tortilla chips with sauce on top. Looked like a cheap mans version of nachos. Can't believe we paid $15 for it. Everything's on the lighter smaller side so be prepared to either eat light or order a lot!  After lunch, that was it. Again, nothing too spectacular. Food is expensive and small. It's much more worth it to spend your money somewhere else. Not missing out if you haven't tried this place at Cosmo.
36	0	I really was expecting more from this. My mac and cheese was kinda bleh. I figured a place that was known for hot chocolate...er frozen, whatever...would have comfort food down pat. Getting seated was kind of a nightmare, and the atmosphere was too bright and crowded for my taste.   I would have tried it again, but several months later I found Max Brenner, which was everything I wanted Serendipity to be.
37	1	We have long anticipated having dinner here and with all the hype over Gordon's celebrity and the Hell's Kitchen competition, it did not let us down. The service was exceptional: from giving us an ipad with the drink menu on it allowing us to email ourselves information on the wine we drank; to cleaning the table of crumbs and replacing the cutlery between each course; to placing our plates of food on the table simultaneously with 2 servers. The food was fantastic. Melt in your mouth, and even though we were stuffed we had to have the toffee pudding which was to die for! We will visit again on our next trip to Vegas!
38	0	I purchased a Groupon for my Vegas trip.  The reviews were mainly average or bad so I took a chance.  What an idiot I am!!  There was a wait which was fine.  I gave my name and number to the semi-nice host for a text message when table will be ready.  She said 15 mins.  I decided to go gamble.  The machine was paying too, however I realized it was well over 15 mins and went back to host.  She said she tried texting me 3 times and showed her logs, which is odd.  I received other text messages and FB messages but not hers. She placed me back on "the list."  About 5 mins later another hostess sat me and hub, she was not friendly.  The decor was nice, semi-clean.  The server was all over the place.  We had to hunt for her a couple of times.  She tried to be friendly but she appeared that she was overworked and just started that day.  The food was not good.  I would have done better looking for a Taco Bell.  Trust me....forget this place, so not worth your time and money.
39	0	Nothing to write home about.  Fancy noodle guy making the them from scratch. ....but the window dressing really didn't match or meet expectations.  In fact, a trip to Panda Express would have saved me $70 and we would have had a better meal.    Never again!
40	0	the food was good and so was the iced coffee but they really did not want to give me much coffee. the first time i went there i got a regular size iced coffee and it was more like a cup of ice with coffee. it was delicious so i decided to go the following day, i ordered another iced coffee, this time i asked for less ice. when i got my coffee, it was filed up 3/4 way, i asked the cashier sarcastically "you guys dont fill up the cup" and all he told me was "u asked for less ice". it was disappointing, i would look for  new place with good iced coffee because they just dont really want to give you your money's worth,
41	0	Do not come here.. Horrible service.. bland food.. waste of time.. Go to Earl Sandwiches instead.    Came here Fri after a night out.. Sat early AM.. and ordered the congee and the duck soup... YUCK.. Worst $23 spent ever and horrible service! Why did it take 30 minutes to get our food? 2 items? No cooking needed, just scooping the soup up... the congee was so bland.. drinking water was better that that.. and the duck soup..The noodles weren't even cooked all the way!  It was still all stuck together.. Waste of time and money.. and it was so hard to track down our server, let alone trying to pay our bill... Wish we just walked out..
42	1	Absolutely love this place!! I loved the concept of an Asian fusion and everything I ate was delicious! A little upset I came in while somewhat hungover, thanks to open bar at Senor Frogs. I didn't finish my food cause my stomach was still a little upset. BUT, it was BOMB!  Husband and I shared the fried chicken wings. I'm telling you, you'd be a fool not to order them. Best wings I've ever had!! We also shared the salt and pepper garlic fries. Again.. The best ever!!  I ordered the Miyagi-San burger with grilled onions instead of onion rings. The meat was flavored SO WELL and I loved the over easy fried egg.  My husband ordered the Kiki burger and I swear I looked down at my food, then up at his and it was gone. That good!!!
43	0	The set up of this restaurant is pretty cool. It's very casual with like sandwiches, salads and things as their food. My cousin and I just really wanted some fries, and we were really disappointed. We ordered just a side of fries, and when it came out we could tell that the fries were old and re-fried. We wanted to make a comment but we were in too much of a rush to tell the cashier. I will come back again and give this restaurant another shot. However, I may not order their fries this time. ENJOY!
44	0	We visited this restaurant for Valentine's Day and had an ok experience. The food was just ok.  We have been to Texas de Brazil many times so that is where a bar was set.  Customer service here was the worst part.  We waited at least 20 minutes for our water that we were charged a "water surcharge" for. The waitress seemed very confused.   The seating is very close to the other diners so if they are experiencing problems you know about it.  The people next to us bought a very expensive package and never received most of the perks that went with it.  Mainly the lobster.  The food at the salad bar was just ok. Not worth the price they were charging.   In my opinion, go to Fogo or Texas de Brazil if you want a good Brazilian experience.    Don't waist our time here.
45	1	Korean fusion at its finest! It is really no wonder to me that this place has been reported to serve the best burger in LV. The burgers here all are so amazing with diverse flavors yet still maintain the classic burger necessities of a quality tasting patty sandwiched between a great bun. I am in love with the buns here thats for sure. They are fluffy, moist, crispy, and buttery heaven. I think part of the reason why i really love this place is because I love Korean food and all that it offers with spicy and diversity in the food. And I love burgers so its the best of both worlds.   I think my favorite burger on the menu has to be the Miyagi Son. It provides a really simple flavor that really packs a punch! The Ronin is a classic as well. They also let you mix it up and customize your burgers so if you're feeling like kimchi on your burger, go for it.   The oxtail chili cheese fries are a must in my opinion. Obviously, anything with a fried egg and garlic aioli on it is going to be delicious but really the flavors on these fries are unreal! They also have a great selection of boba teas if you feel like getting your boba on!
46	1	Admittedly, I would have given this place four stars due to the sheer exorbitant prices if it weren't for the amazing, if not the best, burgers I have had in my 26 years of life. And believe me, I've had my fair share of burgers. Okay - enough about the rave and onto the food:  I must start with the free starter popcorn, which was perfectly salted and just the right amount of butter so good that I had to ask for second!  For appetizer, we ordered the Surf and Turf Quesadillas, which has a combination of broiled steak and lobster that complements surprisingly well topped off with Manchego cheese to give it a rich texture to go along with Avocado cream that leaves a rather refreshing after taste  For main course, I ordered the Rising Sun burger (A must have based on other yelpers' validations) and the steak fries as a side. The juicy Kobe beef spread with the Teriyaki glaze just burst with flavor, but not too salty as it is matched with a slightly sweet addition from the cripsy yam. At the same time, the Spicy mayo and tempura avocada adds a tantalizing kick to the already delicious burger all on its own. I also added a fried Egg which just kicks it up another notch. The steak fries that came with the burger just left me speechless as I could not even taste the grease but had so much crisp and flavor that left me licking the seasoning off of my thumbs   All in all, what more can you ask for than a perfect burger and a beer in a chilling afternoon at Vegas? I would have liked to try Truffle lobster Mac N Cheese but there just was not enough stomach to fit it all or time on the agenda to come back for round 2. Definitely a 5 star unforgettable experience - Super winning!
47	1	It's the place to get a burger.  It's a tradition for our group of friends when we visit Vegas to head over to Burger Bar for dinner.  Build your own burger with best ingredients.  Sides are good too.  100% of the time I've gone to Burger Bar, my burger is cooked perfectly the way I order.  For fresh fancy burgers, medium rare is the way to go in my opinion.  Plus, this week when went, for the 1st time we ordered the Kobe Burger to see what the hype was about.  YUM.  Kobe Burger lives up to it's hype for sure.  (oh and once, a friend ordered veggie patty and vinaigrette salad, she wasn't super happy with her meal).  Burger Bar = stick w/ the burgers.
48	0	I came here mostly because I had a buy one get one free coupon for cocktails. The disclaimer says under 9 dollars... Too bad there are 0 cocktails for under 12 dollars so I just stuck with a water.   My girlfriend got a wet burrito and she ate just a bit because it was "way too dry". How does that happen with a wet burrito?   I ordered a BBQ pulled pork. It was the worst thing I've ever had in my life. It had drown in so much sweet BBQ sauce that chewing it down was almost torture. The sweet fries are on par with Applebee's. I was looking forward the corn on the cob for a nice crunch but it was actually soggy like it was dropped in a puddle. I've honestly never heard of soggy corn. Was this done on purpose? How do you mess up that bad?  The best part was watching some drunk kid sing karaoke from my sticky table.  Instead of going to the casino after, I just went up to my room.  I'm actually writing this from my toilet. Wish me luck.
49	0	We had to pay almost $5.00 for a bowl of RICE!  I could not believe that the main dish did not come with anything else.  Everything is ordered separately.  I know it's Caesar's at the Las Vegas strip, but please, four entrees, four bowls of rice and three teas, one had water, cost over $100 for lunch!!!
50	0	Dear Hooters Las Vegas,  I have always enjoyed my stays at Hooters Las Vegas. Unfortunately that was not the case this weekend. I checked into the hotel on December 5th and was given room 263 in the Bungalow tower. The room was nice as I expected. The next morning on Saturday December 6, my boyfriend and I noticed the hot water was not working in the shower. I called the front desk and they said they would send somebody right away. After waiting half an hour nobody had arrived. I went ahead and left the room and went to the front desk where a gentleman named Marco assisted me. Marco said that he would give us a separate room to shower in. He offered room 448 in the OCEAN tower. I thought that it was completely ridiculous to walk all the way across the casino and take an elevator just to shower. When I complained they said we could just keep the  ocean tower room to stay. (Why did they not offer that in the first place?) the manager also reversed my resort fee which was very appreciated.   After packing up all our stuff we switched rooms at about 12pm. We left the room for the day to visit the strip. We came back to the room at about 530 pm and took a nap. At about 820pm my boyfriend woke up to take a shower. As he closed the bathroom door I HEAR THE DOOR TO THE HOTEL ROOM  OPEN. Keep in mind I am in a t-shirt and underwear laying on the bed! I look up and see a glimpse of somebody walking away quickly and closing the door. Confused I call my boyfriend asking if he left the room and he said no that he was still in the shower. I was completely frightened because someone was able TO OPEN MY HOTEL ROOM DOOR AND WALK IN.  About 5 minutes later someone starts to furiously knock on our door, I open it and a lady in a blue shirt and a man in a black jacket/maroon shirt start questioning me. They state I was supposed to check out today and should not be in the room. When I explain the situation about switching rooms they ask to see my ID. When they check my ID they said thank you and did not even apologize. After a few minutes I walk down to the front desk asking why someone opened my room door without knocking, the manager named "H" (who was also the lady in the blue shirt who checked my ID) denied that anyone opened the door before they knocked. I was extremely upset at this because I know what I saw and heard. She completely denied that anybody opened the door without permission. I am extremely upset at this situation as hooters violated my privacy and also did not take the liberty to update their system to acknowledge my new hotel room. I would like a refund for my weekend.
51	1	I've been going to the Shake Shack for years in Philly and NYC, and being on the West Coast now, I was so excited to see the beloved establishment in Vegas. I was in Vegas for 5 days, I went to the Shake Shack 5 times. - I always go for the Double Shack Burger - the beef is super moist, seasoned, tasty. The cheese is delicious as well. - Crinkle cut fries - get them with cheese on it! - Concretes are solid as well. Be prepared for a quality, delicious burger here. The only drawback is I wish it were bigger!
52	1	This is my favorite place to order Huevos Rancheros. I like that it's made with crispy tortillas and every thing about it is delicious. The very best I have had. The sauce is outstanding! This is not an ordinary Huevos Rancheros. Not typical at all. Try it. Even the employees rave about it.
53	0	I made the mistake of having such high expectations of China Poblano because they were just completely crushed.  I had heard so much about  culinary genius, Jose Andres and that is the reason I even went into the restaurant after perusing the menu.  If it was not associated with Jose Andres, I would have immediately done a 180 after seeing the $11.00 price tag on a serving a dim sum.    Jose Andres is known for his tapas servings and so our group ordered a number of tapas servings to share.  And they were just OK.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't mind blowing either.  If I am paying $8 for a mini mini pork sandwich- it BETTER blow my mind, and it did not.  My favorite dish was the eggplant dish, but it wasn't fabulous enough for me to return. I even tried eating the Chinese dish and Mexican dish, side by side to see if that would make a difference in the "experience", but it didn't.  In fact, I still don't get it.  It was not a fusion restaurant, but rather two menus in one.   The ambience is cool and trendy, but next time I am considering Mexican or Chinese, I will definitely go elsewhere, where the flavor satisfaction matches the price.  I can get ambience elsewhere.
54	0	This is a review of the restaurant inside.  Like so many others, my experience here consisted of questionable food and an unfriendly waiter, who didn't trouble himself to stop by our table even once to ask us if we wanted another beverage or anything else. He sure had time though to stand around looking bored, talking to his buddy near the back where I watched him do absolutely nothing for 20 minutes. So I decided to just walk up to the bar to get my own drink where I was met, eventually, by an ill-tempered gal who did nothing more than raise her eyebrows when I asked for a beverage. The chicken was overdone on the outside, underdone on the inside- shrimp like rubber. Straight up- this place is bad, stay away.
55	1	Went in with low expectations... Thinking it would be cheesy, expensive, mediocre food and small portions.  I was blown away on all accounts. Drinks were huge, portions were generous and the food was DELICIOUS and met the standards of a fine dining institution.   The Ramsay brand did not let down!  P.S. Beef Wellington FTW
56	0	I had an absolutely terrible experience here and I think it ruined the celebrity chef name too.  This was last summer and I finally got around to writing the review. I still have the bad aftertaste in my mouth and I swore never to go back there again. EVER. I'd love to give them zero star if I could.   The service: slow and inattentive.  The communication between servers and chefs was terrible - our dish somehow went "missing" and we waited and waited, we didn't get any apologies for that.  We ordered our drinks first hand, but the drinks came towards the end of the dinner. If we didn't remind them, we probably wouldn't have gotten them.   Their guac was so bland and expensive. We mixed it with the salsa because it was that bland. I can make a better batch of guacamole for 10th of the price. The siu mai was just bad. Everything was so small and expensive for no apparent reason. I'm sorry I even wasted time and money on this place.   Ok, maybe it's fine to go one time for the novelty of the Mexican/Chinese fusion idea, but definitely not worth the price. They made so many mistakes and failed to make up for it all! The waitress came and suggested that she was sorry, but please, we all knew she didn't mean any of it when she sounded and looked so irritated the whole time that I was complaining about the entire experience in front of her. I don't remember if I tipped, but if I did, I shouldn't have.
57	0	If you get this worthless one for 10 bucks  It may still be a bad deal . got it for 20 from half price tickets.please find another buffet to goto.bad food.mediocre taste.reminded me a of a family run Chinese hotel.mind you Chinese options suck as well
58	0	Came in with a party of 12 under a reservation. It took 50 minutes to place our order for food, after an hour seated we finally got our drink order. If you want a burger, one could literally butcher a cow, grind the beef, and cook it yourself faster than the "service" at this restaurant. One could probably drill a well for water faster than they brought it to the table, as well.
59	1	I'm thinking this is the cheapest thing you can buy here at the Cosmopolitan.   Another amazing recommendation from Kristen C. she said I had to try it after a long night of partying. It's $3-$5 dollars depending on the pizza and it's amazing!!! It's good when you're intoxicated and better when you're sober. It's a New York style pizza in Vegas!! Can't ask for anything better. I love a plain cheese pizza and this is one of the best cheese pizza I've had. Well worth my $3 and more. I also tried a white pizza with garlic parmesan, ricotta and mozzarella cheese YUMM.  I will say it's was a bit tricky to find, there isn't a sign outside and you have to walk through a dark hallway before seeing the pizzeria but if you can find it or flirt w/ a security guard to help you out (lol that's how I found it) then you'll be very happy when you do!!   Yummm, I'd love a slice right now!!
60	1	Great environment. The wait wasn't too bad Friday morning. They are very attentive. Got the enchilada omelet and really liked it. What I liked more was the potatoes. Seasoning was amazing on the potatoes. The banana muffin you get for free is surprisingly good too.
61	0	Went for breakfast and waited forever at the front for the rude hostess to even look at us.  Some bitchy granny seated is and lectured us about the dos and don'ts of eating breakfast.  Breakfast buffet was $16.00.  Because everything was not to my liking, I basically left there hungry.  The bacon was like chewing on plastic with artificial bacon flavoring.  The eggs were...(I have no words for them).  The only edible things were the fruits as they did not require cooking.  It was THE MOST DISGUSTING BREAKFAST I HAVE EVER HAD and so not worth $16. I had breakfast buffet at Mandalay Bay the previous day and it was awesome.   Do not eat here unless you have no other option. Between the disgusting food and the unfriendly staff, I can not understand why this dump exists in the basement of the hotels, which smells like a backed up sewer, by the way.
62	1	The place is definitely hidden. First time I came here I wasn't sober enough to remember lol But I remembered enjoying the pizza.  The quality is good, I want to try all of their toppings! Order the one you want and they'll pop it into the oven for few minutes to warm it up :)  It's open super late so you can stop by for a late night drunchie after marquee. The price is very reasonable (especially in Cosmopolitan!).   There are more comfortable seatings outside. Look for the huge red couch!!!! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cosmopolitan-of-las-vegas-las-vegas?select=nj_b27TPNvVtHKkqxo53oA#nj_b27TPNvVtHKkqxo53oA
63	1	Was awesome. Was told an hour & 20 minute wait. Waited for 45. Didn't have to stand there, they texted us when our table was ready so we could walk around the mall. We were seated promptly and the waiter was really kind. Soon as I seen the Farm Burger, I knew I HAD to get it. Duck bacon, cheddar & a fried egg. Food came out really fast I was shocked being that they were really busy. Everything was so good. I should've gotten two. Great experience.
64	1	This is the first of 3 reviews I will hopefully post for Thomas Keller's Restaurants.  While probably the least popular of his culinary trifecta of Bouchon (vegas & yountville), French Laundry, and Per Se, starting off with this restaurant is nothing to be ashamed of.  If you scroll down to Seth W.'s review, I was also in his party of 12 that drank the absinthe and easily had one of the best dining experiences of my life, with good food, good drink, and excellent company.    The first thing that showed me this is a quality restaurant was the excellent, attentive wait staff.  Starting off with a very knowledgeable waiter (who else can explain why castrated chicken is more tasty and juicy?), to a well-versed sommelier who taught us the history of absinthe, we were taken care of through the entirety of our meal.  We started off with an amuse bouche of salmon spread with salmon cooked a few different ways (smoked, pureed, etc.).  Had I known about this, I probably wouldn't have ordered the salmon tartare appetizer, as this tasted a little bit better.  The consistency was such that you could take a butter knife and spread it across the biscuit.  The salmon tartare starter had a similar taste, except it was surrounded by bits of hard boiled egg.  I can't say that it did or didn't complement the tartare well, but the amuse bouche was definitely better tasting without any extraneous tastes that the egg brought.  Never fear though, as I'm confident that I got the best main course of the table.  The Epaule de Porc is a braised pork shoulder with glazed root vegetables, celeriac remoulade & pork jus (quoted from the menu).  In everyday speak, this is the most tender pork that exists.  Saying that it melts in your mouth is an understatement.  Think about a warm tasty porky marshmallow that gives you feelings of the first time you made love, but not as short lasting.  That's about as close as I can put into words to describe this amazing dish.  Putting it in perspective, having this kind of amazing meal for under $100 in Vegas (not to mention in the Venetian) is quite a steal.
65	1	I actually enjoyed the food. My friend had the beef wellington-5 stars! I had the rib eye steak, so huge but delicious. I added a sauce which was a bone marrow in red or white wine. Pretty good but a little salty. The restaurant lives up to its' name. The setting is pretty dark and red inside. Their service was excellent! Someone is always making sure you enjoyed your food and pouring water for you when your cup gets emptied or half full.   TRY the beef wellington, brussel sprouts (has bacon in it)  & mac & cheese! The 3 best combo & for appetizer their lobster.. haha JUST TRY IT!!
66	1	The experience  itself is worth more than 5 stars, let alone the extravagant, picture perfect, work-of-art food. Plate by plate files by you of simply gorgeously displayed craftsmanship on a plate. Does it match up to the visual when it comes down to taste? You betcha! And beyond.  A towering stack of waffles and sagely spiced fried chicken, mounded with fried leeks (Do I eat leeks? I do now!!!). Added an order of scrambled eggs, which it seems silly to say but they were truly the best prepared I can remember. The two of us shared the waffle creation and had more than enough food.  The second Saturday of the month apparently they have this rousing DJ that sets everybody rocking to breakfast. Fun, inventive, artistic food with an attitude and a joint making a statement of swinging for the fences. Loved the experiance and the food!
67	0	Stay somewhere else!!!   Called the front desk at 8am to fix the shower...ummm it's only 3pm still can't shower?!?   Waited in line over an hour to check in. Rude front desk.  With all the choices in Vegas save yourself some disappointment and stay elsewhere anywhere else!
68	1	04/10/2014:  This place is a must for Thai food lovers visiting Vegas. It is a bit off the strip, but, worth the drive. And you'll likely have to wait a while unless you were lucky to get through ahead of time to make a reservation. The cab drivers will also vouch for the popularity and demand of this place.   We had the usual Pad Thai and Papaya Salad for appetizers. The grilled shrimp, green, red, and yellow curries are all good. The squid salad is excellent. The basil and garlic eggplant dish is excellent. You can substitute green beans if you're not a fan of eggplant. If you like your food spicy and your guests do not, make sure to ask for the fish sauce and fresh Thai bird chillies. That gives it a nice kick. Just be careful, it can make a grown man cry. One if our guests tried some and had tears run down his face as he grabbed for the Chang beer.   Chang beer is the best pairing for Thai food - IMHO. They have a huge wine cellar and it sure looks impressive behind the glass room. However, I just can't seem to muster up the taste buds to pair this amazing Thai food with wine.   I have been to this restaurant several times before. Finally making the time to recognize this place for the fine food it produces. I've turned a few business clients on to this place. They are hooked too. Always a must for me when in Vegas. Some reviewers describe this place as the best Thai food in the US, it's hard to argue with them.
69	0	The worst of the worst...... Omg....... Don't even think or get attempt by it from buy one get one coupon....  Horrible... Very narrow choices of food and taste is the worst.. Everything is either sweet or way too salty... I couldn't even eat two plates... Will never come back....
70	0	The customer service was very nasty!! I will never go here again and will pass the word on to friends and family!! I never would have expected to watch some as whole throw my food into the bag because the cashier as whole didn't confirm that it was and order to GO!  Got into a verbal confutation with the lady who threw my food in the bag!!.. Since I didn't have bail$$ I let her keep her teeth...  A little encouragement to the as whole lady please find yourself another job if you're unhappy with the Hot Dogs business!! The Original Pinks is in Los Angeles Ca. a much better place to go and eat a hot dog and know the customer service there has better class.
71	1	Oh Bouchon Las Vegas. I'd love to able to say that I've had to pleasure of enjoying the food from the Yountville establishment, but my travels have brought me to Vegas before that.  Greg and I selected Bouchon after looking at the menu (extensively) and the wine list (more extensively) and thought that this would be one of the shining moments in our trip, assuming we didn't win millions of dollars in the casino.  As it turns out, I'd say this was a pretty awesome experience and not anything that felt like were in Vegas at a hotel on the Strip.  After being seated we were given bread on the table, and told that the bread was meant to be eaten with the room temperature butter (hard table butter = loss of a star) and some Dijon mustard.  Absolutely delicious, and continued to eat through two servings of the bread.  Our waiter, who I am TERRIBLY sorry to have forgotten his name, was warm, pleasant, not cheesy and very informative.  He helped Greg select a bottle of wine for us and also helped select a sampling of the fromage from the menu.  Ultimately, we selected the Bleu d'Auvergne, Pont l'Evque, and the Fiscalini Bandaged Cheddar.  The cheeses were accompanied with some fuji apple slices and honeycomb, along with cranberry walnut toasts.  We agreed that the top two cheeses from the selection were the Bleu and Cheddar cheeses.  The third cheese was a little too stinky for our liking, even with the honey and apples.  For our appetizer, we selected the Molle Rtie, or the bone marrow dish.    And here is where I completely break down.  This dish falls into the category of dishes I would have no shame in licking the plate.  The bone marrow, served with two bones and toasts to accompany, was soft, delicate, and melted onto the toasts.  The part that blew my mind = the reduction sauce that comes with it.  I mean, this sauce is COMPLETELY out of this world.  The consistency was just a touch lighter than French Onion soup but came with all the wonderful flavors including juices from the bones.  I mean, this dish in itself is worth coming here for.  We asked for more bread so that we could dip it into the sauce, secretly debating whether or not we should go as far as licking the plate.  I was sad when they took the empty plate away.  Our waiter was gracious enough to warn us that the Steak Frites came with a mountain of fries, and since we were both ordering it, that one of us have a side of steamed garlic spinach instead.  Completely insightful and helpful when I saw the Mt. Everest of fries piled onto the plate.  The steak came with an herb butter and was a generous sized portion.  Greg and I literally ate until it became unbelievably uncomfortable, which meant that we had only gotten through about 80% of the steak and 60% of the fries.  I was saddened by the fact that I had overindulged in the things leading up to this, but had no regrets in doing so. Ultimately, the poor little side of delicious garlic spinach sat half done and I really made an effort to finish my plate but had to wave the white flag before it was gone.  Naturally, we passed on dessert although I had a cappuccino to try and start the digestion process and enjoyed being in each other's company for the rest of the time.    This was a great experience, and we really enjoyed everything about Bouchon.  Previously we had been to Bradley Ogden in Caesar's and was sort of so-so on the whole dining experience.  I'm glad we selected Bouchon, it completely exceeded our expectations and created a new standard for fine dining in our opinion.
72	1	You see that "R" by my name? I'm a regular here and I don't even live in Vegas. That's how much I've been here. Oh, do I miss the 7am breakfast after a long night... and I just got back from Vegas a few days ago. This was the closer of the night/morning. After a grueling night with the City of Sin, we, along with many others, find ourselves here at the Grand Lux Cafe. I think I've been here 4 times in 3 days.   The food is surprisingly very good! I ordered the pizza lunch special on my first visit and loved it. It didn't get me stuffed but I was full and content. Better than eating a buffet, where I always over eat and feel like crap come dinner time. Came back the next morning... or some would call it... a few hours later and had the "healthy breakfast" which consisted of chicken breast, egg whites and some veggies. I did not expect it to be good, and it wasn't but it wasn't bad either... it was healthy (understandable).   Had a legit breakfast here (like actually waking up in the morning and coming here). The breakfast buffet was excellent! The selection was very limited but the items that they have were all great. The hash browns were cooked to perfection, not burnt but not undercooked. The omelets were great too.   Lastly, had one last breakfast, this time it wasn't legit (due to the fact that there was no sleep prior to this breakfast) Don't know what I ordered, could be my lack of memory, or we can just blame it on the night.   Now to the service. It was excellent every time we were there (and I remembered). I must say though, our waitress for breakfast was absolutely wonderful. Definition of great customer service! If i knew her name I'd let you guys know... but the entire staff at the Grand Lux is amazing. Great service!
73	0	Was excited to come to the Riv again since they announced t was being demolished.  Had such great memories here as a kid.  But WOW was it BAD!!  The only thing that was god was the parking.  Both myself and my daughter got ill after eating breakfast in the caf.  For 3 breakfast items it was over $50 with a tip and it was HORRIBLE!!!  Very sad to see this historic landmark go but employees have already checked out.  Stay away and go somewhere else.
74	0	Literally every section has the same three items ( bacon, eggs, and sausages). There's a very small selection. This will be my last time eating here. Awful food and service during breakfast. I'm highly disappointed that I wasted my money and time waiting in line.
75	1	Oh have mercy on my soul THIS was amazing!!! We were seated right away, the service was incredible and the FOOD oh man, so good wish I had another stomach! We started with the Ox tail chili fries THAT alone sold me on the place. Then we had the Bahn-mi burger and the Ronin burger holy mother of god they were SOOO delicious. Our server came and checked on us without overly checking, which was great because we were too busy stuffing our faces! LOL we then finished off the meal with Portuguese doughnuts...the coffee ice cream was to die for. I can honestly say, THIS has been such a great food orgasmic experience that we will ALWAYS come here when we're in town! Thank you for the amazing food and service! An absolute must if your in town!
76	1	I don't eat much Thai food.. came here purely because of the hype from online reviews, and realizing I've never been to a Thai restaurant with such acclaim.  Plus this was one of the few times I had a rental car available when visiting Vegas.  Fresh and marinated raw prawns with chili paste.. what a great and unique dish. The serving came with 8 large shrimp that I shared with dining companions, but I could have polished off a plate of these.  I also loved the crispy fried duck served with a congac based curry.  Again, another unique dish to me and I couldn't get enough.  We had other dishes that I can't complain about, but these two were clearly the standouts.   One thing I would mention, the spice level was not nearly as high as I assumed. We ordered "medium" and my next go round i would go high as I felt there wasn't much heat at all. That didn't take away from the fact that I really enjoyed my meal here.   Prices are very reasonable for what you get. This is a very good choice to take a break from the flashy casino dining.
77	1	The Gold Standard burger lives up to its name and more. Possibly the best burger that I have ever had in my life!  Their shakes are a fun treat as well. The Apple Pie is one of my faves, with real bits of apple, making it literally taste like they shoved an entire pie in a blender with some rum and ice cream and served it in a giant glass. Also, they give you the extras, so you're really having 2 milkshake glasses instead of one. A tiny girl like me can take one down and be content for the rest of the evening.  Here's a fun tip for you club-goers: Head to Marquee early and get your stamp. Once you're in, get your drank/dance on for a bit and then leave to go to Holsteins downstairs for a mid-club snack. When you're done, go back upstairs to Marquee's re-entry line and dance the burger/night away. Best way to spend a night in Vegas.
78	1	My wife and I have stayed in the Venetian on numerous occasions. But never have considered dining at Bouchon until recently. I would have to say... hands down... one of the best dining experiences ever. The wait staff is very and their attention to detail is superb. The food quality is excellent. For dinner i ordered the mussels entree. The mussels were cooked with saffron butter and white wine. The portion size was very filling, and it came with a huge side of  crispy delicious french fries. My wife had the flat iron steak, but instead of fries, mac n cheese was substituted. I snuck a bite of her steak, and it was tender and juicy. The "Moscow Moose" (vodka, ginger beer,  and lime) is a must have. I would come back for the Moscow Moose alone.  My wife and I are definitely coming back here, if we're in Vegas. Luckily they have a location a couple hours away.
79	1	The service was awesome; very fast, helpful, cheerful, and polite! And the food was absolutely delicious. I visited this place twice during one visit to Vegas bc I couldnt get enough of it :) My favorite was the Drunken Sea Bass, Red Curry, pork larb, and the mint duck... all reasonably priced. I know thai food and this is it, yum.
80	0	My fiance and I stopped by here and ordered from the to-go line. We ordered a pretzel which was awful. It was hard and dry. I had expected it to be warm, soft and fresh. We also ordered a frozen hot chocolate. It was expensive, not worth it, and I would rather have just gone to Starbucks and ordered a frozen drink.
81	0	Great location, atmosphere and service. But the food, the food. The food is the rub. Every meat was overcooked and dry. It's a steakhouse and I expected the signature food to be much better.  Be sure to get the coupon from the girl out front. But even at half price, it's still no bargain. Maybe try at lunch when prices are already lower.
82	1	The Egg & I has the freshest eggs you can get at a breakfast restaurant! My scrambled egg whites were fluffy, light, and delicious! Their homemade banana muffins were yummy and their fruit was fresh! The restaurant itself is quaint and adorable. And you can't beat the price (especially if you've spent the weekend shelling out tons of money for food on The Strip!) This place is definitely worth going out of your way for if you're visiting Vegas!
83	1	One of the best New York style pizzas I've ever had. This place really is a secret in that it's probably impossible to find unless you ask someone. It's down this remote corridor with no signage or anything. There was also a bit of a line, but boy the pizza was worth every minute of the wait.  The slices are a decent size and the flavor is awesome. the crust is beautifully crispy. I would eat the crust by itself as a loaf of bread. That's the secret to an awesome pizza in the first place. Add to that flavorful fresh ingredients and you have a winner.  Just an FYI - don't expect a restaurant type setting. There are a couple of bar stools, but basically it's a take it to go type of place. Again, the win is in the food itself. Really good.  I highly recommend Secret Pizza to anyone visiting the Vegas Strip.
84	1	I'm keeping this review short since there are so many to review from.  Service - 5 stars Food - 5 stars Price - 4 stars (a bit pricey but you get what you pay for so to speak)  We were recently in Vegas celebrating my boy's bachelor party.  We came in with a party of 10 and were instantly greeted and seated.  They gave us some pistachios and bread to start with.  Try the bread with a little butter and their home made mustard.  The combo sounds kinda weird, but it's killer!  To warm the taste buds, I ordered the cream of mushroom.  It was very tasty but nothing extraordinarily different.  However, for my main course, I ordered the sirloin steak sous vide with vegetables.  Mid order, I asked the waiter if I could swap the veggiies for fries.  He said, the order comes with the veggies but that he'd bring 3 baskets of fries for our group on the house.  And as for the steak, it was vacuumed sealed to capture the juices....and it definitely tasted that way.  Juiciest Sirloin ever!  Cooked to perfection and was super tasty.
85	1	This is an over the top unique restaurant..that "nails" it on almost everything....and I'm giving it yelps highest grade...but I'm not certain I'd ever return. Its almost an exhausting gastronomic experience....I walked away from here completely satisfied....very very full.....yet almost mentally drained. Its a really happening place.  Its noisy...dark..hustle-bustle. we didn't really care for the atmosphere...not relaxing at all....our table was very close to the waiters pick up station..constant commotion going on.... the food is off the charts terrific...... .Christopher,our waiter, was very very good. Knew the ins and outs of the menu. Even in the frenzied atmosphere he took the time to walk us through everything we needed to know. Drinks are robust and made perfectly. the bread is almost a meal onto itself....he explained what we were getting.....soooo good! as apps...the british ale onion soup,the blue crab soup and the Caesar salad got high grades. My wife had the fishermans grill/lobster,mussels and scallop mix and loved it. my son,daughter  and I each had the roasted beef wellington...fantastic! Christopher explained twice why we didn't want beef wellington for 2..so we each had our single portion. you can't make this at home! mac and cheese side dish was fabulous. you must save room for the sticky toffee pudding for dessert..we shared....almost puts you in a sugar induced coma. All this comes at a high price but we all left here happy. this is definitely NOT your fathers old stodgy steakhouse.
86	0	Use to love this place. Use to! Not busy Friday night and now I may know why. Ordered a filet and was tasteless. Server reordered it and had it chard. Took forever, our table was almost done eating. STILL NO FLAVOR! .......REALLY!!  This is a steak house for Pete sake. Spend some money on a salt and pepper shaker. Sister and spouse tried it too and agreed. Manager said they season with salt and pepper and are usually heavy on that, then followed up with "a filet usually has little flavor". Huh?? Asked him to try it but he refused. But just continued to argue the point but would not try it. He Just liked to continue to say I was wrong. So I was done! Sooooo done! And manager did nothing to make it right I mean NOTHING! But he got out of there quick. Maybe he was not the manager!  Just presented us with the rest of the expensive bill. So after we left our party. We went back to our hotel the Wild Horse Pass Resort so I could eat something. I was so starving since I had only bread and my husband sat and watched. REAL FUN NIGHT!!! So maybe the General Manager should call us if they care.
87	0	Ok. When you go to Las Vegas to get the hell away and have to pay for airfare as well. All I can tell you is it's old, worn, but CLEAN! I did feel as if I was stuck in circa 1978 for a few days but hey! It actually worked for the money. It's not fancy and far away from the new part of the strip so I suggest instead of paying for monorail tickets bring or rent a car!
88	1	I can't believe how great this restaurant is.  It is a gem.  We come to LV every year and my husband found this on the web and we decided to try it.  What a deal for the price.  We had lunch there.  For less than $13, you have two selections of meats, one salad or soup with one appetizer.  On top of that, we get 7 side dishes.  The portion of the salad and appetizer is huge.  How I wish they can open one in San Francisco.  I would eat there every week. You have to try it to believe it!
89	1	Ordered the meat lovers for two and a steamed egg and was very happy with everything. Had a great selection of meat and wasn't disappointed by anything- all was good quality. The bulgogi was my favorite.  I recommend the steamed egg, it was one of the best I've had. The combination also comes with a large salad which was nice. Only thing I would improve is the cucumber kimchi, which was too sweet.
90	0	Sub par restaurant. The place wasn't to full capacity, and I waited 25 mins to be seated and I had to wait 15 mins before a waiter approached my table. I had a grilled chicken salad from McDonald's better than the one I had tonight. Rolls brought to the table were not hot, but rather straight out of the refrigerator. In addition, the entire time we ate the housekeepers were vacuuming close to our table and two maintenance personnel walked past our table carrying plungers. Disgusting!!! The waiter was polite, but didn't fix the issue of my chicken breast being tough and poorly seasoned.
91	1	Once again, Hash House A Go Go is a must! I hit Hash House A Go Go on Friday for lunch. I got there a bit before noon and only had a 15 minute wait for lunch. My previous two visits were about the hash so this visit had to be about the Chicken and Waffles.   Wow, the plate, like all of their others, was huge! Two breasts with drummies and about two full waffles with the bacon cooked into the waffle. Making this to order took about 20+ minutes for it to get to the table and it was worth it. Gotta say the chicken was good, the waffle was good but as another review said - a little more syrup (okay, "Maple Syrup Reduction") would have made it a bit better.   I ate about 2/3 of the plate and gave up. I was so full I did not need to eat for the rest of the day.  This restaurant stays on my must-visit list for every time I go to Vegas.
92	0	Gave them one star because I couldn't do no stars.  The food is fairly decent, but it is not out of this world. The service is what lacks. It is not difficult to treat customers well or be up front with them to be accommodating.   We had a group of 5 and the server was extremely rude and even made comments toward us as we left.   For a town that host trade shows and borders California it is easy for us to visit Vegas often. Since my visit in January 2014 i have not returned to Serendipity 3 and do not ever plan to again.
93	1	My southern grandma passed away without sharing some of her famous recipies with the family.  This place has food that tastes just like and similar to grandma's!  The tastes of the warm biscuit (with fruit topping) and rich mashed potatos really took me back to my childhood.  The portions are HUGE, you'll probably need a to go box.  Cost is low considering the value.  The bill for two people with a 25% tip was $53.    I thought it was interesting that they don't have heat lamps, so food gets delivered to your table as it's ready.  REALLY that's how it should be, everyone gets their food as fresh as possible.  The presentation of the food is very thoughtful and the taste is rich (heavy, southern style).  Don't expect to eat for the rest of the day, you'll likely be too full! :-)  I had a mint latte here that was one of the best I have ever tasted (and I've had tons of lattes)!    Our waitress "Kai," (short hair, enthusiastic) was super nice and helpful.  We saw her stand on top of a chair to take a picture of a large party at a table- that's service!  We'll be back and likely ask to be seated in her section. :-)
94	0	Back to my Vegas trip...  We came here after walking around on the strip and aside from the place being super dark I was kind of excited to see what they had to offer.  First we must have came in the back way because I couldn't find the hostess or a server walking about.  Finally tracked one down and after some finagling we got seated upstairs.  The upstairs was nice but we didn't get a good seat to view the strip so we got tucked away in a corner which probably lead us to being ignored for a good 30 mins before we even got our drinks let alone placed our order.  I should have taken the cue to leave then.  We placed our orders and the waiter disappeared for another hour and finally brought back our food.  Seemed he was preoccupied with the lovely ladies in the other part of the restaurant.  I don't blame him, but at least check back once in a while.  We ate and left, the place was decorated well but the food was pretty mediocre.  Disappointing.
95	1	Most foodies know about the legendary Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas. All I can say is this...the curry here (specifically the Panang) is BY FAR the most exquisite Thai curry I have ever had. The nuance, the balance and subtlety of the flavors is incomparable. I've never had anything I didn't love and I've been going here for almost 15 years, but the Panang curry is truly a masterpiece of culinary excellence.
96	1	Ever since Triple D came to this restaurant, I had been dying to go. Now that I have gone...IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT!!!  -Oxtail chili cheese fries are excellent. The flavor is outrageous with all the different asian infused spices they use. -The ronin burger was great. It was juicy and worth the money.  Would I go back...HELL YEAH!!
97	0	While the entire buffet scene in Vegas have gone downhill over last few years, this one is especially BAD.    I came here to try their Sunday "Gourmet" Brunch.  Its 32.95+ tax but the it was a huge disappointment!  In Short, don't waste your money to come here.  The line was non existent when I came.  I felt it was not a good sign.  The foods were quite mediocre.  They have alot cutbacks for their brunch.  King Crabs are gone, snow crabs instead (Like Wynn).  FYI, King Crab only available on weekend dinner so I have been told. The quality of the crab is....crap.  Soggy and soft.  Lack of flavors.  Rest of the foods were non remarkable.  The presentations weren't good so did the taste of food.   Dry steaks, dry salads. Horrible Asian stations and their Italian station didn't look too good either.  Their desserts are one of their best tasting station to save this review from having 1* only.  I like their cheese cakes and apple pie but rest of them are just ...blah.  Save of your money and go somewhere else.  If you are on comp.  Try to venture other a la carte dining options in this hotel or other MGM properties.
98	0	I was SO EXCITED to try this place and I only ended up being beyond disappointed . The service was horrible and rude, the wait was long, many things were overpriced, and the frozen hot chocolate wasn't special whatsoever. Overall, this place is far over hyped and simply not worth it at all.
99	1	This place is pretty good. The food is not the best, but it's good. The buffalo chicken wraps are really tasty. The chicken parm was a bit toooo breaded, but even the lunch serving is MASSIVE. The "small salads" are huge! Just on food, I'd give this place 3.5 stars. BUT! They're 24 hours which is really nice to have a place 24 hours in the hotel and the price is right! Most places in Vegas, the pricing is at a premium, but this place? It's a deal!! Ate here 2 times with a family of four and both times got out for just about $50.
100	0	I had the worst experience ever in a las Vegas hotel! Being a local on a Thursday night I decided to try westin They serve until 6 am and I  figured it was a great place to grab a late night dinner. As I get to the bar, nobody takes my order. I struggled To get the bartenders attention, whn I did he tells me that he can't serve me and that he has been directed to call security. So I politely asked if I could speak to security. When security shows up he refused to speak to me or even look at me. He also says he can't help me, so sitting here baffled I ask to speak to a higher management. So security manager Dean comes over and again can't give me an explanation of why I can't be served all while looking me from top to bottom making me assume that he is profiling me. After I ask the reason behind this he says he cannot tell me the reason but that he as the right to refuse service. He said i am more than welcome to come back to speak to Ben noble at 9am.
101	1	Whenever I go to Vegas, I eat at the Burger Bar because of their delicious burgers and exceptional salted caramel shake.  I am even more impressed with the staff and management of the Burger Bar because I hosted my wedding reception of 21 guests there last weekend. I made reservations over a month ago so we didn't have long to wait. They arranged tables through the center of the restaurant because they don't have a private room.The service was excellent (I think the server's name was Gina) and our food arrived quickly and perfectly prepared. Thank you Burger Bar!
102	0	I have frequented the Spice Market a number of times when I  was in Las Vegas.  Every time it was excellent probably the best in the city.  I took a party of 9 today for breakfast, spending over $180 only to find the quality had fallen off significantly.  As examples, the cheese on the cheese platter was dry and the edges curling.  The baked oatmeal was so over cooked that you could not get a serving spoon to break the  crust.  The bowl of compote at the crepe station were very unappetizing.  In fact the bananas foster with peaches resembled vomit.  I infact spoke to the manager, Keith, and his.attitude was that he could care less and did missed my comments.  Save your money and find another breakfast buffet.  This review should actually have 1star but the attitude of the waitstaff was excellent.  The only.redeeming feature of this Buffett.
103	1	If I could give 6 stars, i would.  I had heard about this place for over a year from co-workers who travel to Vegas regularly.  I get my share of Vegas as well but this place is about 6 miles away from the strip and I hear it's a pain to get a cab back.  So it's taken me nearly a year to try this place, but i'm glad i finally made it!  Enough storytelling, time for the good stuff.  Bachi Burger puts an Asian spin of the traditional burger and combines some of the things you love in Asian cooking into a sandwich.  Our goal was to try as many of the burgers as we could as there were three of us.  First, great beer selection here!  We started off with the oxtail chili cheese fries and it was a perfect side option for 3 people.  Comes with an egg on top.  The yolk mixed in with the chili and cheese is just the right amount of gooey goodness.  Again the goal was to try as many burgers as we can so we each decided to get something unique and promised to eat one half and split the other half into two so we can all get a taste of each other's.  This was a brilliant idea and I recommend you all try this if going as a group.  Burger # 1: Miyagi Burger - It's their signature burger and comes with grass fed kobe beef patty, some sort of amazing sauce, fried egg and onion strings.  Amazing texture and taste Burger # 2: Spicy Miso: Simple with an amazing spicy sauce that provides just the right amount of heat. This was my favorite! Burger # 3: Unagi Burger:  This one costs $24 but it's well worth the price.  It was a little too sweet and rich for my taste but def worth a try  So after all this we sat there.  Our stomachs were full but we still wanted to end with a bang. The debate was if we wanted dessert, and if so which ones.  Except I had another brilliant idea and recommended we get another burger and split it in three.  I think we were all thinking the same thing, I was brave enough to say it.  So we sat and wondered what else are we going to go with.  Our wonderful server recommended the Mr. Hong, since it was different than what we had already tried.  And what a great recommendation it was!    So like I said, in the beginning, I'd give this place 6 starts if I could.  Not only was the food great, our server made sure we were taken care of from the moment we walked in.  I'm making Bachi Burger my go to destination every time I visit Vegas.
104	0	OK I have as good of a sense of humor as the next guy. Probably better. But this place just plain rubbed me the wrong way.   I understand the premise of the place, staff treating you like garbage and you're supposed to laugh it off as part of the charm, but for real, you gotta draw a fuckin line somewhere.  My story: A friend and I came here to grab a drink and we see a bunch of people wearin these weird paper hats with things like "asshole" and other insulting shit like that written on them. I won't write what some of 'em say because they were just plain gross (especially for a place that serves food), again, understand where the line is.   So I start talking to one of the bartender chicks and she tells me the hats are insults that they label individually and, in one of the most twisted compliments (may have been a pass, I really don't fuckin know or care to know for that matter) I've ever had heaved at me in my life. She says to me "like if I was to make a hat for you it would say 'You're not worth the AIDS I'll get," I really couldn't believe she had the gall to say that, but I managed to maintain my cool and dish it right back to her saying "right on, so if I was gonna make one for you it'd say 'titties in progress' right?" then just turned around and walked away.   I'm not HIV positive or have AIDS but can you fucking imagine, if I did, the lawsuit I could file against this place?!?!? Also if I did, that would just not be in the most poorest of tastes to say. Even for a place like this.  Anyways the moral of the story is, know when to draw a line if you're gonna run this type of joint because it's a pretty slippery fuckin slope and shit could get real bad throwing words like that around.
105	1	Wake me up before you Go Go because I'm not planning on going solo.  Hash House is amazazing. For all you "What Would You Do?" fans, the Hash House served as a backdrop for many of their scenarios. More famously, they are known for being on Man vs. Food. And unless you have an appetite like Adam Richman, I suggest you bring a friend to help you eat the madness that is "Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Hash House Farm Benedict." It is to die for! Chipotle cream with peppers, scrambled eggs, griddled mozzarella, fried chicken, bacon, market tomato, spinach, and biscuit on top of griddled potatoes. This is literally the best breakfast I ate in Vegas. If you're a fan of country fried chicken, this is right up your alley. MUST. EAT. NOW. Check out my photos if you need inspiration.
106	0	DISGUSTING!  After waiting for an hour, we finally arrived near the end of the line where I can grab my strawberry soda. After paying my cheap admission price of ~$12, I was eager to start my dinner with hopes it would be decent given all the hype.   10 minutes later, I ate raw canned corn which were half cooked, a piece of steak that was rock solid when suppose to be medium rare, chow mein which tastes far from even mein, and lukewarm broccoli. It made me really appreciate the other bad buffets I have been too. This is by far the worst buffet I have been to.   The floor was grossly dirty. Pieces of bread and meat lingered all over. Parents were letting their kids roam free, dropping ice cream and strawberries. I even saw a kid pick his booger out before using the same hand to grab a corn on the cob. Needless to say, I lost my hungry appetite FAST.   The salad bar was not any better. The lettuce was not in cold temperature. The dessert section was mediocre with plain peach cobblers. Not worth the drive. Now worth the wait. Not worth the price. Just not worth it at all.
107	0	I ate here yesterday and the cottage cheese was spoiled! I have never tasted such bitter and sour cottage cheese. Someone could seriously get sick from eating spoiled dairy products. It's very serious that the buffet is not checking their products and looking out for the safety of their guests. I was so disgusted I will never be back to the buffet and because of this experience I definitely will not choose to stay at this hotel. If they put spoiled cottage cheese on the buffet I would hate to see the quality of the rooms. Overall just a very nasty and awful experience.
108	1	We're from Los Angeles - on vacation. The wait wasn't as long as we had expected - but a much longer wait would've been worth it! Liza was super attentive, friendly, & warm. We highly recommend this place to anyone in Las Vegas area. We had Mimosas, stuffed French Toast, & the Works Chili Skillet; simply the best!!!
109	0	Upon exiting, I look for the Riviera Casino and Hotel. It appears that our GPS is guiding us to the slums. Moments, we are driving to a very old section of Las Vegas. I don't mind that classic feel, but when it's no longer maintained and businesses appear to be gone as well, it's quite depressing.  Arrival to the Riviera... .... ....  I've driven over 4 hours to arrive to a line with at least 50 people, so I'm sorta expecting a fun and entertaining counter to get my mood swinging UP! Check-in counter employees do not appear happy or mad, but they are quite depressing to deal with. They seem to be sick of their job.   I will never reserve a room here again. It is bad. My non-smoking room smelled so bad, I felt healthier breathing in the casino floor and/or hallways! The AC couldn't be adjusted to be comfortable, so it was either blistering cold A/C or hot HEAT. The unit didn't seem to be drawing fresh air either. The standard room's bathroom is small, and I couldn't hang my towels because the hanging mounts were all broken. The toilet barely flushes. The sink water has strong pressure, at least. The 1950's had it very well, but they can no longer compete with casinos on the strip. I would book Circus Circus before giving this place another shot.  I should have snapped a picture of the air filter (they actually have one!!) located inside our room. Last I checked, filters are meant to be replaced, not in continuous service while the white filter media is BLACK!!!!!!!!!  Why did I book this? It was the cheapest rate at the time (still above $120). However, it is off the strip, very depressing, and just not a place to dwell. The casino floors, however, was active and appears OK. They had one (1) Pai Gow table on a Saturday (9th) November, and people playing that night (8PM to 4AM Sunday) all received a FAT 5-ACES bonus for betting on the ENVY. 4 players received $1,000, and the 5-ACES hand landed on the Dragon Hand.  You would not believe the PIT BOSSES faces. They made us feel that we didn't deserve to win. They scrutinized the dealer at the time of win, and came back to ask more questions 3 hours later (after shift rotation)! Unfortunately, they weren't expecting to payout that much on a single Pai Gow table and it was clear that they were hurting that night.   At the cashier, I was asked "where did you win all this money"? I mean they were all on high alert since the table payout was $4,000 in bonus payout, and many bonuses throughout the period.  I will never stay here again, but  I would play at their casino floor, hoping for another good bonus flop!
110	1	One bite the Rising Sun Burger and you're in beef nirvana.  And one bite is all I got, because my dinner companion, AKA significant other, wouldn't share after that.  But that's ok, although my Longhorn burger wasn't as good, it's no flakeout in the burger department.  Just not as exotic an explosion in your mouth as the traditional Japanese flavors that are perfectly introduced into the western standard that is the burger on a bun called, once again, The Rising Sun.  And let me tell you, this burger planetarian will now orbit around this fabulous burger.  The beers are nice and cold and that's what I reverted to after an uber strong margarita on the rocks.  I treated it like a shot, cause at $14 there's no way I'd leave it sitting on the table.  We were seated immediately, the service was fast, extremely friendly and ready to answer any questions we had about the menu.  I can't wait to go back, and guess what I'll be ordering next time?  Hai, The Rising Sun.  Arigato Holsteins!!!
111	0	Not impressed. Evening dinner before a show on 1 Oct 16.  Very poor start with reservations running behind.  When we were seated 10 minutes behind our time there were plenty of seats available. Some tables had things others did not even the basics like salt and pepper.  I looked over the salad bar while waiting on the server and it was not worth the effort. We ordered the drinks and the meal immediately since we had the time to read the menu ahead and the drinks showed up 5 minutes behind the meal. (15 minutes). the meal was prepared well but the serving size to cost was poor (almost twice what I would pay elsewhere for a filet mignon). Our server was slow on checking on drink refills and even slower handling the check. They were using a tablet system to order (supposedly for the first night) and finalize the checks but watching him the receipt printers were a challenge.  The restaurant itself looked satisfactory as far as decor but the bathroom was undersized for a restaurant of that style where people are going to stay and eat a while for their money.  I am certain we could find a better place on the strip.
112	1	Everytime I'm in Vegas I have to eat here. I always order the farm burger and the jalapeo poppers this this is the second time I have the hod burger and first time was good but plain. They now made it much better and now preffered over the farm burger. Not comes with jog patty, hog bacon and hog bbq pulled hog with so much melty cheese
113	1	Don't know what to order? Get the Rising Sun burger. The most delicious burger ever. Perfect combination of richness, sweetness, and savoriness. Words cannot explain how wonderful tasting this burger is. The burger consists of Kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, and tempura avocado. Burger comes with fries as well.  Definitely a little on the pricy side. The burger was $18, I believe but it was definitely worth it. Really good quality and something to try at least once if you're in Vegas!
114	0	When it comes to Lee's Sandwiches, I'll guess the answer is I'll have to come back in a few months to see if they're doing anything differently.    Unlike a few other Yelpers who have had a Lee's Sandwich experience before, I've never been to this chain and really wanted to go as soon as they opened.  I really like banh mi and wanted to see if this place stacked up to other local establishments.  Unfortunately the service was super slow (perhaps due to being relatively new) and the sandwiches were not up to par.  I found them to be REALLY skimpy on the toppings as there were quite a few bites of my charbroiled pork sandwich that consisted of just bread and pickled carrots. I brought a bunch of friends with me to try it out and their sandwiches were equally..."empty".  I hope they understand that my desire to go to Lee's was to try them for the first time and not to show them a great place to eat.  As with some other places to eat here in Vegas, Lee's seems to be one of those places that is good just because it's open.  The quality is not there, we experienced really slow service and the sandwiches are skimpy.  I like the baguettes but there are better if I'm willing to drive to them.   Overall, not the best, but something to eat if you need to soak up some alcohol after a night of going out.  As I'm a cab driver, I'll probably never go there for that reason so I guess I'll go back in about 6 months to see if they've gotten any better.   Before I forget, it seems that Lee's has an abundance of ice as their drinks (coffee, iced tea or soft drinks) are mostly ice.  Make sure you don't get thirsty here as their drinks are mostly comprised of ice and you could end up spending a fortune to quench your thirst!  Maybe that will make the sandwiches seem like a better deal?
115	1	I'm not all that crazy about spending $13-$20 on a burger, however, with that said, this place had a pretty darn good burger.  I got the buffalo burger and it was awesome.  I'd still rather go to the Apple Pan in Los Angeles, but this place is definitely up there. I was especially happy with the hostess.  There was a 40 minute wait when we got there.  We didn't want to wait so our party sat and ordered at a few open seats the bar had.  We saw a few tables open up about 10 minutes later and no one sat at those tables.  I asked the hostess if we could sit there and she initially told me that if we had already ordered at the bar we had to stay and eat there..house rules.  She then went to talk to her manager and in a few minutes we were in a booth.  what more can I say than...Niiiiiice!
116	1	This was my second visit and I was just as pleased as the first.  We found Lotus of Siam via a new acquaintance last time we were in Vegas.  We were unable to get a reservation (the history on my phone shows 27 attempted calls, all of which received a busy signal), so we showed up at 5:20 on a Friday night.  They open at 5:30, and we were not the first in line.  We walked in right after the door opened, got a great table, and enjoyed a fabulous meal and glass of wine.    I am gluten-free, and have been pleased that they will accommodate different preparations of certain dishes to meet that dietary need.    Their wine list is impressive, and not ridiculously overpriced.  When we left a little after 6:30 every table was full, the vestibule was packed, and several diners were waiting outside (yes, in the skeezy strip mall).  The moral of the story is that this place is worth the stop, even at what many would consider the "Senior" dining hour.
117	0	Got a groupon deal here for a really cheap room for the weekend. Room was whatever, kind of big, got a free bottle of wine so that was cool.   Not cool part?   they charged me for outgoing long distance phone calls to a phone number that nobody in my HUGE GROUP OF 2 even has in our phones, and they said someone called out from our room around 1 am. REALLY??? #1, both of us have cell phones, why the F would we use your stupid landline. #2, 100% sure I was at XS during that time dancing what's left of my youth away.   DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!! SHADY SHADY SHADY
118	0	This has to rate as bad as the Stratosphere buffet, only worse because at least at Stratosphere someone will get you a soda, a refill, and clean up the area around your table.   I was so hungry and didn't feel like walking back to Mirage or Treasure Island, both of which have great food, excellent service, and reasonable prices. So in  a rush to get some food I settled for Flavors. Wow! What a mistake.   Upon walking up to the cashier to pay for my meal, all three cashier continued their conversation, looking at me, saying nothing to me, and talking for over 2 minutes. Finally I said "can I pay here to eat in this buffet" and they looked at me liked I had stolen their kid. Isn't the cashier at the buffet suppose to take your money. And from here it only gets worse.  The hostess seats me at table next to a 80 year old man that has no respect for the space around him, or himself. The piled plates, the newspapers scattered around his table, and the booth on both side of him covered in his thrown about newspapers. The hostess tells me to sit and leaves all the newspaper on my seat. I looked at her like she was crazy and she pushed the papers slightly for my butt to have a clear space.   From here... oh god, the food is disgusting. Fat and grizzle in the roast beef so bad you can't chew it. Old crusted over foods, and empty containers of food everywhere.   After I sit down and eat my food I finish my soda, I say to the waitress can you please get me a diet coke and water. She snaps back..."this isn't my section, I am off." Now she is clearing tables, and is dressed like all the other servers, and she is the only one in my area. So I say.."can you please find the person who is working I would like a diet coke and water." She says, "let me see what I can do."  A trip to get a wilted salad and over 10 minutes later I still have no soda. So I ask to see the manager. This buffet was $28. I have no problem with paying $28 to get a decent meal and decent service. Flavors is far from decent anything. Stay away it's a dump.
119	0	So a vegetarian walks into a burger joint.... But seriously, my two partners wanted burgers and this place boasted a veggie burger, so I was sold! Result? Food was good! I did the Inferno Burger with a black bean patty (skip the warm lettuce) and add onion strings. It was yummy, good kick of spice and the patty was charred to perfection, just enough to crispiness. My boyfriend fell in love with the bacon & eggs sliders. He called the mini quail eggs cute- and devoured them. My BFF had the Dante with a turkey patty and loved it- especially the blue cheese. Bad news though!! Service was bad, bad, bad. They need to look at their staffing plans- our server was swamped with too many tables! She was filling drink orders, ringing up checks and helping at least 6 tables; meanwhile, 2 hosts were standing around doing nothing. At least 4 guys were bussing tables and done, standing around with nothing to do. There were at least 4 bartenders, yet they were all standing together taking. My drink never came, and we had no utensils while our food sat at our table. The saving grace was how nice and apologetic our server was!
120	1	I went for lunch. I got a pesto scramble and I have to say this was one of the best flavor combinations I've had in a while. There were eggs, pesto, whole spinach leaves, cheese, and I think some tomatoes scrabbled to fluffy perfection.  My fianc got the western omelette and he said it was the best he's ever had.   We bought a groupon at $24 for $40 worth of food so it was a good deal too, but I am definitely coming back in the future.
121	1	A perfect bite after a night of drinking and dancing, enough to soak up the alcohol and slap you back to sobriety.   My BFF and I decided to play a round of pool after the club and after hustling it from several unsuspecting men, treated ourselves to pizza. From what I can remember at 4am, the place wasn't marked with obvious signs of house made pizzas. But what was vivid was kicking off our heels, putting our feet up and enjoying my glorious cheese pizza- with extra money in our purses.
122	0	This hotel like all the others need to STOP CATERING TO SMOKERS PLEASE. If you truly enjoy breathing second-hand smoke while gambling, walking through the casino/hotel, eating, etc. then this is the place for you. It was really hard for me to like this place. The rooms are average. They charge to even drink the water which is really sad. This was my last stay here.
123	1	Located in Planet Hollywood, Gordon Ramsay Burgr can be found near the front entrance to the right of the Miracle Mile Shop entrance.  There were only 2 in my group, so the wait was not too long.  I'd imagine a larger group would have a longer wait, especially during a peak time.  I had already planned to order fries and a burger.  My waitress told me that the burgers can sometimes take a while to cook, so she suggested that I have my fries come out first so I'd have something to munch on.  Worked for me, but something to note in case you're sensitive about that type of thing.  If you order the sweet potato fries, go ahead and tell your server that you're going to need an extra serving of the honey jalapeno mayo that comes with it.  That stuff alone could get 5 stars.  It is so good.  Also, the order of fries was large enough to share between two people.  For my burger, I ordered the Farm Burger.  It's served with cheddar, duck breast bacon and a fried egg.  In case you missed that, I said duck breast bacon.  This was a delicious burger.    One helpful piece of info, if you are a Total Rewards member and show your card, you can get special pricing that comes out to a $1 off several items.  It's free to join at the Total Rewards desk found in the casino.
124	1	This was hands-down the best food I've ever eaten. Had the pork belly appetizer, fresh oysters (I'm an oyster connoisseur...these are the best, FRESHEST I've ever eaten) beef wellington, and seafood plate (can't remember the actual name of the dish.)  Drinks were fabulous. Portions were perfect. Oh, and the dessert! Sticky pudding is to die for. Eating here was an awesome experience...in itself worth the trip.
125	1	Awesome burger! The prices are well worth it! Fresh and delicious. I ordered the blue cheese burger and it was to die for. The truffle fries are also delicious and will feed up to 4 people. We also ordered the pork belly steamed buns and OMG! Must try this place and will definitely go again!
126	0	I recently made a huge mistake and stayed four nights at the LV Hilton. I used some of my HiltonHonors points for the stay. The room I was in was nothing like the website pics reflected. It was absolutely filthy. One of the light fixtures was broken. There was an upholstered chair in the room that had some white stuff running down the front that had dried. (You guess on that one)   The bed was the most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept on. It felt like metal springs with a thin skin of fabric wrapped around them.   Most of the restaurants have closed up. The Italian restaurant was only open fri and sat night. The coffee shop closes from 2-5 pm daily.  If you have a late lunch at this hotel, you will eat off of plastic.   The casino floor is filthy and desperate need of renovation. The pool area was dirty and in need of a few plants.  It is hot and windy and not very pleasant.   I will never stay at this hotel and would not recommend it. I have sent a letter to HiltonHonors requesting my points be refunded.  No matter how good the deal is they offer, don't stay here.  You will not be pleased.  After four nights here I checked out and was able to get a nice room at the Palazzo for the remainder of the week.
127	1	I am still salivating over the delicious meal I had here!    Starters: my 3 college buddies and I shared the beer battered maui onion rings (the best onion rings I've ever had) along with the truffle parmesan fries.  The portions were so generous we didn't even finish them!   Milkshake: I didn't even know pudding on top of a milkshake could be a thing but oh boy does it take this icy treat to the next level!  I opted for Shake #4 (crme brle pudding + oreo shake + oreo cookie) and it was so delicious that I inhaled it in record time.  It was one of those genius concoctions in which I wish it was in a bottomless glass.  Word of advice: use the large straw they give as a way to scoop up every last drip of pudding   Burger: I've had so many incredible burgers from the East to the West Coast that I wasn't expecting to be as blown away by the Hell's Kitchen Burger as I was! They grind the patty blend onsite and this leads to the most flavorful and juicy burger you could ever imagine.  Add in the asadero cheese, roasted jalapeo peppers, avocado, and oven roasted tomato and you have one of the most flavorful culinary experiences of all-time.
128	0	Other than the hella hyped up frozen hot chocolate, this place is mediocre at best. I ordered the chicken tenders appetizer with 3 dipping sauces. And I swear, the chicken tasted like paper. It only tasted okay when I dipped it in a sauce. I didn't even wanna eat it after I got a box for it and brought it with me back to my hotel.   The next day, I went back again before the end of my trip. I ordered the chili since I was starting to feel sick from the whole weekend. After eating half of the bowl, I couldn't finish it because it was so spicy. It was very good though, since it had filet mignon chunks in it. But the spice was just too overwhelming.   Next time, I'll just have the frozen hot chocolate and that's it. I'm done giving their food more chances, only to be let down on more than one occasion.
129	0	Avoid. Used to be good. They wont steam the crab legs for you unless you're a VIP member. Guess my $30 isn't good enough for them, yours probably isn't either. Go elsewhere, don't be left with a bad taste in your mouth. The food selections are hit and miss. Scampi, prime rib, sausage n peppers, fajitas and guacamole is ok. Bunch of other stuff not so great. Service is questionable. They only pick up dirty plates-eventually. You have to get your own drinks. No purified water, just tap.
130	0	I guess memorial day weekend was not a good time for tao. Everyone was pissed because we were all there to see Kaskade who didn't even come on until 2. it was supposed to be a 6 hour set and along with that all of the employees kept saying he was coming on at 1. Maybe it would be better to go on a not so popular weekend. I literally couldn't even walk without being seriously scared that I was going to die by stampede. Other than that the decor was cool and if you eat at the restaurant girls are free and guys are half off. It was alright...

The weather is hot so I gamble that I can get a table at the bar between 5 and 6. Bar tables do not require a reservation. I show at 5:30 and there is a premium table available. Yes, call this 'Money Won.' and is twice as sweet.  Immediately capturing your attention is an eye-catching, restaurant-wide Union Jack ceiling mural and custom neon sculpture. I also notice a second level up high with table service.

132	1	I'll keep it short. As with most things in Vegas, you get what you pay for. Try the shell fish appetizer- it has a high price tag for an appetizer but you won't have a better variety of fresh seafood presented to you better than this. The wagyu beef skirt steak (like most American wagyu, this wasn't real wagyu, but an incredibly close offering) was incredible! The beef Wellington was good except the dough fell off the steak because the knives weren't serrated to cut clean through. They don't do serrated knives because they claim it tears the meat. Disagree with that but that's ok. Overall great restaurant and you might get a chance to see a celebrity chef at work.
133	1	Hidden little gem in Cosmopolitan hotel! This place has no signs, and they do not advertise it. It's one of those... if you know about it type of thing. Funny thing is, I learned about Secret Pizza in an airplane, and knew I just had to try it for myself.  It's tucked away in a little hallway, full of people who just got done clubbing. I guess some can easily say it's drunk people food. Absolutely not!! I believe they do not advertise it because it is "Secret Pizza" after all.. I think this place would appeal more to the young adults. There are no actual tables, and just a little bar counter with a few stools and chairs... maybe five? There wasn't really a place to eat, and it would have been pretty awkward to eat there while the line of people stare at you because of the way it was arranged. I recommend getting take-out! Long line, but they do try to get you out of there as quickly as possible. The crust is extremely thin I assume so it can cook much quicker, some of the veggies are pre-cooked in advance, and the mushroom is sliced paper thin to reduce cooking time.  I've eaten pizza from here at least 10 times, and I think it's safe to say it's my absolute favorite pizza joint!   The pizza is delicious! I think it's one of the best one's I've ever had. I still crave it...... WHYYYY do you have to be sooo far away!?!? Well I think only in vegas will I be willing to cough up $40ish for my pizza. Worth every penny though!! The slices are very big, and they are pretty generous with their toppings. I ate at almost every eatery/ restaurant in Cosmo, and I must say, this place was my favorite! I had to eat here twice, and still craved for more!! The menu is literately typed and printed on normal computer paper. The cover of the menu simply says "Pizza"  I ordered a Five Toppings "Pie"  $29.00 -18 inches, 10 slices. Each Additional topping was $2.25 Toppings Pepperoni Sliced Sausage - Yum! Meatballs Roasted Tomatoes Fresh Garlic- Added a very nice touch Green Peppers Mushrooms-sliced so paper thin to reduce cook time..almost couldn't taste it! ): Onions Ricotta  Overall, I can't wait to go back!! I would highly recommend this place, enjoy!!!
134	1	Little gem away from the strip.  Very creative and mouth watering burgers. Ok, the fries are amazing too.  We got the truffle fries and the chili fries.  Both are super tasty. The black and green burger,  the Kiki burger and the regular bacon cheese burger were out of this world!  The blending of the flavors and the quality of the craftsmanship elevated these burgers to a new high. I'm not even done with lunch that I'm completing this review. Amazing experience and absolutely delicious food.
135	0	Was craving a frozen hot chocolate all week long prior to going to Vegas, so I walked down here after doing a bit of shopping at the Forum shops. Seeing as how I was ONLY gonna get a frozen hot chocolate, I went to the line outside and thought, oh, this is going to move fast cuz there's only 4 people in front of me.   Waiting  Waiting  Waiting  Waiting  20 min later, I finally get to the front of the line. SLOWEST MOVING LINE EVER! Why do they not have more people working here when the line moves at the speed of molasses. My grandma can do cartwheels faster.   Anywhoo, after paying a ridiculous $10 and waiting over 20 min, i finally had my meh frozen hot chocolate. Wasn't as good as the first time I had it. I feel sorry for the people who were waiting behind me in the growing line.
136	1	Tropical cocktails in colored pictures and in massive glass globes, pink neons lights cast strange shadows on the faux foliage, gilded mirrors makes the room look like a ballroom while the cocktail servers, clad in floor-length ball gowns and soft sex voices, sashay around the bubbling fire pit.   Strange place. But yes, I still take every one of my out-of-town friends here. Every single one.
137	1	The ambiance sells this place. Old school Vegas lives here. Reason enough to visit.  The lounge is a great place. Sit around the fire in water and enjoy the blue neon glow. Wait staff varies. I have been to this place many time spanning 2 decades. I love the joint but the waitresses are hit and miss. Often a miss. My recent visit she was pretty slow both speed and on the uptake. Bartender is good though and again, the place is just cool to visit.   Restaurant side is also a visual splendor. Food is "OK". Edible but you are not going to leave saying "wow great food". Unless all you care about is portion which 90% of the tourists seem to fall into (large eating large).   I would tell anyone to visit both restaurant and lounge side for an experience the rest of Vegas has lost. Great date spot.  For movie buffs the scene in Casino were Sam and Ginger are sitting having a drink and she returns to be asked "any change" ... that's the Peppermill lounge.
138	0	On our 3 day streak eating buffet (we've been to Bellagio, Mirage, and Wynn for dinner/lunch), Aria buffet was the worst quality of foods, and unbelievably unfriendly staff off all hotels. Fail expectations for the price.   Rancid shrimp dumpling (Har gow), so bad I spit it out. Shrimp cocktail that still has its shell unremoved. Oysters were fishy and sloppy, a sign that expired. Cold king crags legs that were overcooked. People went through them because a. Lot of them were just undesirable and people picked all over them leaving only scraps. Nothing remarkable.  Esther showed us to our table. She failed to let us in after we had walked to check out the food, only to tell us to go back to end of line, no exception. She unwilling to make better of the situation by letting us use mlife line.  Staff only care about their responsibilities and won't call server too come to you, even though ours was no where to be found.  Don't go here for buffet. Terrible food terrible service.  Tip: go to Wynn for best flood Best service.
139	1	While I'm usually a traditionalist and love my prawns with heads on, tentacles flailing, and beady eyes glaring at me,* I am willing to give Lotus a little hug...because if you take fat, juicy shrimp, glaze them with some sweet and hot sauce wrap them in bacon and fry them until the bacon is crisp and the juices from the bottom dweller are oozing about, you've got yourself an amazing dish that should never be passed up. I don't care how (in)authentic an appetizer it is, as long as it screams CRASH BANG BOOM in my mouth, that's all that really matters.   And then there's the vegetable dish complete with various stir fried vegetables that seems as though they've been sitting in a vat of chili oil for years. They're spicy, juicy and perfect. The pepper seeds through the dish let you know that this is a Thai serious dish and you better damn well order sticky rice to offset some of that fire ferocity.   Lotus. A flow. A sweet, pretty pink flower. So innocent. So harmless. Has turned my mouth into a raving lunatic. I want to go back to Vegas...but not for the grand casinos and the sexy showgirls, but for the bacon wrapped shrimp and an entree so unbelievably piquant that I'll have to return...to know that the Lotus wasn't just a mirage.   *Kidding. I hate things with heads.
140	1	This is our special occasion restaurant even though it's not too fancy. It's kind of in the ghetto, but it is so worth the drive.  Everything I have ever had here is fantastic.  Not sure what it's called on the menu, but the crispy prawns with their heads are super yummy... and the drunken noodles, nam kao tod, tom kah kai soup, coconut ice cream which seems like it is home made, sticky rice dessert, etc. are all unbelievable.  Oh I can't forget and my new fave green papaya salad...so nummy!
141	1	The Egg & I has got to be the best breakfast dining experience I've had in Vegas. The place is busy because the food is excellent for a really good price and the service is very good.  Food: 1) Banana Nut Muffin was the best I've ever tried so far. You could tell they used a lot of butter because it was so soft and flavorful! 2) Benedict - The eggs were poached perfectly and the hollandaise sauce was amazing. Perfect execution of this dish. 3) Ranch potatoes were FANTASTIC. They were seasoned perfectly and not overly salty. They didn't have that heavy, thick potato texture. It was lightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Service: The hostesses knew how to handle the influx of people waiting and the servers were friendly, helpful, and very efficient. We even got water refills without even having to ask.
142	0	I wanted to love this restaurant..., I truly did because I heard Jose Andres was the Chef owner and as a DC resident I love anything Jose Andres!! One night my girl friends got take out after a long day of partying but her sister is a foodie so the fact she said her Seafood noodle dish didn't have lobster and it's $50 and then  said her food was  not  good, I became  worried because I was really excited about eating there. So Saturday after a long day at A Cedric Gervais pool party, hungover and starving we went to eat here and the food was not good at all. It was salty it tasted like MSG and I felt sick after my meal. I wouldn't be too excited to eat here again . Sooooo Disappointed :/
143	1	This place immediately ranked in my top 10 restaurants list. The concept is cool - burger and milkshake bar - and the create-your-own burger is a great touch. What is more Vegas than the option to make your own burger and top it with a lobster tail or just have a plain ol' cheeseburger? This is what I love about Vegas, culinary free reign in every shape and size at every price point. Viva!  I had a turkey burger with caramelized veggies, a side of fries, and a Nutella milkshake. Talk about heaven! The flavors were great, quality was very good, prices were fair, service was attentive, and just an all around great lunch. I would go back in a heartbeat!
144	0	one word - OVERRATED!  The fam bamz decided to come here for an afternoon snack.  We heard about the rave of the "Frozen Hot Chocolate" and wanted to find out what the hype was all about.  It was around 3pm and to be expected, the place was mad busy.  There was an hour and 1/2 wait for a party of 8.  There was plenty of outdoor tables and the weather was absolutely phenomenal during the month of March. We decided to try out their take out orders.  It's a limited menu but again, we were there strictly for dessert.  We were in line for 45 minutes.  I don't understand why there was a long wait when the orders consisted of ice cream.  I passed on the frozen hot chocolate - why do I need to spend $15 on a milkshake?  I went with the huge chocolate donut and the Forbidden Sundae which consisted of chocolate cake, chocolate and vanilla cream, whip cream, chocolate syrup, and a cherry on top.  I waited another 15 minutes for my order to be prepared.  I saw my sundae sitting on the counter underneath an air vent that was melting my ice cream. It took another 10 minutes for the server to grab my donut.  By the time I was handed my sundae, the whip cream turned into milk and spilled over the cheesy cup.  The cake was hard and chewy.  The ice cream underneath and had already turned into mush.  It was the MESSIEST sundae I have ever dealt with.  It was sooo messy, that it got me angry and I just wanted to throw it away! The donut was nothing special....just  big.  This was the worst experience ever! Everyone wants to eat here because of the movie; well, I'm hear to tell you that the service and food is below standard!  WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!  If you want real ice cream, come over to the bay area and hit up MITCHELL'S!  Mitchell's is worth standing in line for!
145	0	I'm about to go on a Vegas binge sometime soon, this review was supposed to come earlier but I've been busy this whole year! Anyways, I digress, here are some quick tips:  1. At time of writing, Bayside Buffet does still have discounts through MyVegas the facebook/iphone app.   2. Strategic timing is key. If you come at 10:45 AM for Breakfast M-F, you can get in for $17.99 and then stay for lunch when it's bumped up to $21.99. This is just common Vegas buffet savvy though! However, this DOES NOT work for dinner as it does start at 4:30 PM regardless of the day.  3. Brunch begins at 7:00-2:30 on Saturdays/Sundays.   We rolled in on a lazy Saturday afternoon around 1:00 PM towards the tail end of brunch. We knew that there might be a lot of people waiting to get in, but we weren't prepared to see that the line was pretty much completely empty. Regardless, we walked up presented our MyVegas discount to get in for 2 for 1 without problems, and then walked up to the buffet.  I remember around twelve years back heading to the Bayside for the best crab and the best desserts on the strip. A lot has changed for the worse. It seemed as though almost everything that we had was either lukewarm or cold. Even things that were supposed to be under heat lamps were still cold!  Still, being hungry, we decided to sample what they had to offer. I picked up various pieces of meat from the grill, some italian dishes, and tried their sushi. One of the things I figured out quickly was their was really low quality and the steaks that they had were mostly tasteless and full of gristle.  Furthermore, the pasta sauces were watered down and the sushi was a complete utter joke. Then again, sushi at Vegas buffets are usually not really top notch at all, but this was just seaweed covered disgusting, cold, and hard rice.  The dessert section was not any better. Most of the stuff was melting and leftover chocolate streaks from stuff already taken by other guests was all over the plates. Most places at least replace the plates that food was taken off of.  Anyways, what upset my girlfriend and I the most was one particular dish. There was a baked rolled up piece of salmon that seemed like it was going to be hot. As I cut into it and opened it up, I discovered that the inside seemed to be raw. Note, this was not some sort of fancy salmon tartar or salmon sashimi, this was supposed to be a baked piece of salmon that was fully cooked.   Anyways, I notified the waiter who promised to talk to the chef. I watched this interaction to see what would happen. The chef talked with the waiter, looked at the fish, set it down, and went back to laughing and talking to another coworker. The waiter came back and told me that the chef said it was cooked, but when I asked for the waiter's opinion he told me he wouldn't have eaten it because it looked raw.   At this point, I asked for a manager. I couldn't believe that the chef would be so careless with his guests. If he truly believed that the fish was cooked, then he should have come back and served that piece of fish to me. Instead, he didn't even come to hear my feedback or anything. Anyways, the manager chewed out the chef, took note that really almost everything was cold, and also comped our meal. So props to the manager who deserves 5 stars, but the rest of the buffet deserves 0 stars.  I would not come back to the Bayside Buffet, but perhaps your experience will be better! Best of luck to you all! :)
146	1	Ordered the "Las Vegas" dinner for two, was worried it wouldn't be enough food for two but we were completely wrong, it was more than enough, essentially a sampler of an array of meats and side dishes they offer. Everything was absolutely delicious, steak, prawns, chicken, all the meat was very tender and you grill it yourself, great service.
147	1	Every time I come to Vegas this place is a must. The servers are very sweet (shout out to Jessica, our amazing server, who told us to go for the waffle with strawberries and cream - it was amazing and fluffy and warm and oh man. Miss it already. Sigh) and their little egg notification for need something/satisfied) is adorable. Go. You won't regret it.  Get the skillet. Their potatoes are SO GOOD.   Check in for their free banana nut muffin. It's also SO GOOD.   What are you waiting for? Go!!!
148	1	I came here specifically for the Urth Burger with no intention to even glance at the milkshake section of the menu. But somehow my eyes were caught by the words "Guava Float."  Damn, that sounds good. Skyy Citrus Vodka, house-made guava soda, coconut sorbet, pink bubble sugar, completely dairy-free! I just had to order it. Damn... http://su.pr/1OTBxJ  Sipping on this fruity paradise made the atmosphere a little more tolerable. You see, I had flown into Vegas early that morning, spent most of the afternoon walking all around the strip and all I wanted was a quiet relaxing dinner. Little did I know that the Marquee nightclub was right next door and Holsteins tries to draw in that Saturday night crowd with a DJ playing loud booming music and having the waitresses wear short, tight, red dresses. But somehow, the Guava Float ($11) made all of that tolerable. I couldn't taste the booze but I was feeling that buzz :)  The Urth Burger ($13) was rockin! House-made vegan patty, lettuce, tomato, cucumber, sprouts & avocado. Yummmmmm!!! The skinny fries that it came with were also dangerously addictive. http://su.pr/2KKpvM  The artwork in here, which I think is created by a local artist, is kickass! One of my favorites: http://su.pr/6tjK9n  As good as everything was, it was also extremely filling. Thank goodness for leftovers that save me money while in Vegas! And yes, next day Urth Burger with skinny fries are still good!  Great food, great service, fun atmosphere. Who would've thought that a vegan can not only survive but be amazed by a burger & milkshake restaurant! Viva Las Vegas :)
149	0	I had a bad experience, although the hotel itself is not bad.  I was feeling ill during my stay (I was pregnant and didn't know it), and had been doubled over in bed with my iPod to comfort me.  I left the iPod in the sheets unknowingly, and when we checked out, I must have left it there.  Later that day, I called the LVH reporting I had most certainly left my iPod in the room (it has never been found in our possession since).  They sent someone up to look for it, but it was nowhere to be found, and housekeeping had already been through there.  It had not been turned in by housekeeping.  I don't know how many hotels hold housekeeping accountable, but they were never able to find out who took it.  Some housekeeping person has a very nice gift now.    Bummer.  As for the hotel, we find it to be a good deal, so we stay there occasionally.  It has decent restaurants and lively hallways.  The rooms are clean and attractive enough.  It's too bad they don't have a way of finding out who cleaned certain rooms to determine which of their staff are thieves.  Not sure how many hotels are able to do this anyways.  The experience was enough to make me not want to stay there next time.
150	1	The dipping sauces for the grilled meat were great! Highly recommend the happy hour. I had the spicy chicken with lemon sauce, broccoli, and the mushroom medley on brown rice. Definitely a good place if you're trying to eat healthy and on the cheap in Vegas.
151	0	Do not stay here! The room was so disgusting that I could not even spend the night. There were stains all over the carpet, it smelled musty/moldy, the bathroom was falling apart (i.e. the floor was missing pieces, the counter was stained, the shower was dirty), and on top of all of this the walls were paper thin! My fiance and I were only there 10 minutes before our neighbors arrived and we could hear their entire conversation. I understand not to expect much at the low rate they offer, but the fact that I couldn't even take my shoes off or was willing to put any of my belongings on the bed was enough to force me out of there. There are far better places to stay in Vegas!!
152	1	Wow, this place doesn't mess around with their chicken and waffles.  The chicken is roasted to perfection, they put bits of bacon in the waffle batter, and it comes with the most devine vanilla syrup ever.  This place has some of the best french bread I've ever had and their chocolate "bouchons" (basically chocolate cake in small cylinder shapes) go perfectly with the three different ice creams served on top.
153	0	Unfortunately, this bar has false advertisement provided by desperate promoters outside the bar. First off they give you a bracelet and make you believe that the entrance is free, when it really wasn't.  Second,  the promoter told us that the bar closes at 4 am, we got there about 2 am and they ended kicking everybody out at 315. FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!  I'll never go back.
154	1	Had an early dinner here with my bff.  We shared a liter of wine, and it was the best stinkin cab I have ever had.  Sadly, I don't remember what it was.. maybe cuz of the 1/2 liter of wine I had that night.  haha.    The food here is amazing!  Started with the hazelnut beet salad and wine glazed pork belly.. the salad had pickled ramps that were so tasty!  No strong onion flavor.. it almost tasted like asparagus with a light spring onion taste. And the pork belly was crispy and creamy at the same time!  Served with a ramp custard, the two were a match made in heaven.    For the main course, I had the pork loin served with a baked ramp custard, roasted Anjou pears and morels... To die for! Kinda tasted like Korean food.. which is a good thing.  Pork and green onion pancake (sahm gyup sal and pah jun).  My friend had the lamb, but I can't say too much about that since I don't like lamb.  :)  For dessert.. we had the creme brulee and Ill Flotante.  The creme brulee was pretty standard, but the ill flotante was like a fluffy cloud of dreamy goodness.  Haha.  it was soooo amazing!  airy meringue in a sea of anglaise and a little gravy boat of fleur de sel caramel sauce.. holy mother of all good desserts.    For the two of us, we spent close to 300.. yes, it's pricey, but for a splurge meal, it's as good as it gets!
155	0	Love the frozen hot chocolates but the service was really bad for us!! We sat down and waited for ten minutes and had to flag someone down to ask to take our order. "I'll find a server for you."  was his response. A family sat down right after and a server tended to them right away. We looked around and noticed that we were the minorities. Id hate to pull the race card but thats how I'm perceiving it. Disappointed is what I am.
156	0	What a disappointment! The food at our local hospital cafeteria is so much better! The "prime rib" was steamed. The turkey breast dry. The salads were messy. The sushi rolls tasted "off". And to add insult to injury we were seated in kiddie land. Why? We had no children with us. And we were seated where all the children (I counted 12, with different families/tables, under the age of 5) were going ultra sonic. There were plenty of tables available elsewhere. We pointed this out to the hostess who pointed to a table....2 feet away. Duh. Very annoying experience. This buffet was much better in 2004.
157	0	Our group ate a predetermined BBQ meal consisting of chicken, beef rib, beans, corn on the cob, salad, and a roll. Paula Deen would be proud. Much of the food I had in AZ was piss poor. I was hoping to order off the menu which I assume has got to be better. The view isn't all that great either. What is there to look at? The buildings downtown waaaay off in the distance?  The urinals(2) in the men's room are placed right next to each other almost like it's designed for siamese twins to pee in. There is no divider. What a joy to have some idiot step up and piss that close to me. I could only picture there being splatter all over my jacket & pants. Ugh, what an ordeal.
158	1	If your looking for a great Breakfast spot in the LV area, look no further.  This place was great.  I ordered 2 eggs over-easy, with Potatoes and bacon.  My wife got an omlet.  We also ordered a biscuits and gravy.  Everything was AMAZING!!!!!!  It can get kind of crowded in the AM on the weekends but its worth it.
159	1	This was a positively sublime burger-eating experience.  When in town for a weekend, this was the one place I wanted to make sure I stopped by, and I wasn't disappointed.  Buddy and I each ordered the kobe beef burger and couldn't have been happier.  The meat was prepared perfectly, and the list of available toppings was extensive.  I love that the toppings went from mild to wild and cheap to expensive.  This is probably the only place where one could get a burger with both shaved truffle slices and velveeta.  I went with carmelized onions and gorgonzola - delicious!  As others have said, you must try the sweet potato fries.  They are well worth the extra expense and are scrumptious.  One last piece of advice - do the call-ahead seating.  The restaurant doesn't do reservations, but you can call ahead up to a half hour.  My buddy and I did this and were able to walk right in upon arrival.  The place was packed, and the relatively huge line that formed behind us didn't care for us all that much.  In the end, the price was more than reasonable, given how well-prepared and customizable the meal is.  There may be a better burger somewhere else, but I certainly have yet to find it.
160	0	my friends and i stayed @ T.I. last week and and while waiting for our check in we went  to eat at my first Vegas buffet.  Ive had better "free school lunch" food! the only saving grace to this place was the dessert station, and the only standout there was the  Mini Crme brle
161	0	I've been to Tao about 6 times in the past 2.5 years and I've always wondered...what is the big deal?  Yes, the venue itself is pretty sweet...but pack it in with hundreds of sweaty people? Not so crazy about it.  The first time I came to Tao, I had a blast. The second time was great as well, and it just manages to go down hill from there.  The club is large and has several levels, a huge dance floor and a few different rooms to explore.  Not to mention Tao Beach that they managed to slap on the last couple of years.  It ended up just being an extra line to stand in getting in and out of Tao Beach.  Tao, to me, is an overrated, over-crowded club that isn't worth the hassle.  There are TONS of promoters for the club...and if you manage to walk around the Venetian during the day without getting hassled by one, I'll give you $1.  I think the endless lines and lists and eager club goers to get into this club is because of the promoters and the name itself.  So bravo! The people over at Tao accomplished what they were going for.  However, aside from the cool Asian-influenced decor and the HOT rose petal girls sitting in bath tubs, nothing else makes the club super worthwhile.  The crowd is about a B to B+, though the more people they let in, the scale starts to slide down a little.  Who would I recommend the club to? Co-workers I don't like.  It's just way too damn crowded.
162	1	It can be a long wait but it is definitely worth it!  I've been here twice on Saturday's and usually wait between 15-30 minutes and that was for 2 people.  Can't remember what I got the first time but I know I enjoyed it because I came back for seconds. The service is great, and they even have these placards on the table to let your server know you need service instead of being that person to flag them down. Very useful. Highly recommended!
163	0	Our dinner at the MGM Grand Buffet was horrible.  For $40 per person you think they would offer something that tastes good.  Everything we tried lacked flavor, even the crab.  I've never had crab legs that were absolutely flavorless.  The desserts were OK, but why pay $40 per person for dessert.
164	1	One word:  Ridiculousness.  I already knew Bachi Burger was amazing before their appearance on Triple D, but they really have outdone themselves with one of their newest burgers.  But first! The appetizers!  I had the oxtail chili cheese fries for the first time. The chili is sweet unlike the norm. And I liked the spicy mayo-like sauce that was drizzled with it. Lots of flavor and definitely filling. Make sure you share this one!  I also had their pork belly steamed buns. A nice thick, tender piece of pork belly in every white, fluffy bun. The pork belly was melt-in-your-mouth amazing, but the sweet hoisin-like sauce was the best. I could drink that.  Now onto the main attraction! I saw their Shogun burger written on their chalkboard of specials and I knew I had to have it. A burger made with a wagyu beef patty, foie gras, unagi, Asian pear and miso butter with a Yamamomo peach as a palette cleanser.   They had me at foie gras.  I come from Cali where the delicacy was recently banned, so I was all in with this burger!  You start off with the Yamamomo peach which looks more like a piece of lychee. It's the sweetest piece of fruit you'll probably ever have. Good stuff.  After you take one bite of the burger, you'll feel like eating it slowly so you can savor each bite. The saltiness from the foie gras enhances the sweetness of the pear and unagi. And there's also a hint of truffle oil on the top of the bun. The combination sounded weird at first, but all the flavors really work together. Probably the best burger I've EVER had, but it has a hefty price of $25... WORTH. EVERY. PENNY.  If you love foie gras and burgers, you definitely have to try it. Share it with someone if you have to. Just make it work!  By the way, there always seems to be a wait here, so don't starve yourself too much before you get there (like I did). You need to be awake to try this ridiculousness.   I can't wait for them to open up their next location in Los Angeles!
165	1	Slow service so have plenty of time. LOVE the food here. I recommend almond boba, the ronin burger, steamed buns, fish chips, and hot sake. My kind of night! Art on the wall is cool too. This place isn't for everyone. Seating is a little uncomfortable and you can here everyone else's dumb conversations. You also have to have a palate for this stuff. Also, hard to see from the street so keep your eyes peeled.
166	0	Quite fair.  For reference - I've been to several other churrascarias - from Boston, MA to Nairobi, Kenya.  I came in alone killing some time and needing a quick lunch while out in Vegas for a conference.  To be frank, the food quality at Pampas just kind of lacks.  The salad bar was mostly bland and ill-prepared or overcooked.  The service was fine, but sometimes awkward and at times brusk.  I attend my conference annually and won't be back to Pampas next year.
167	0	The air filtration system in the rooms are in poor condition. On two occasions of my stay here at the hotel, both times my room smelled like wet mops and mildew. I awoke coughing after an uncomfortable rest in a room that's scent choked my lungs.  The lobby staff IS friendly and aside of that, the rooms are , at most, barely tolerable.
168	1	WOOOO, Shake Shack. I still have dreams about you.  I'm so glad we decided to cancel our original lunch plans to stop in here. Best decision we made all day.  The was a bit of a lineup, but it moved quite quickly. After ordering, we're given a buzzer which was cool. A little more organized than calling out numbers. The location was kept very clean and modern inside. It wasn't too hard to find seats, as there is a lot of turn over here and guests are considerate to leave once done their meal.  We wanted to try the original, so we ordered the double, draft root beer and a strawberry shake. All GREAT! The burger was just so melt in your mouth delicious. It was a tad salty, but that didn't stop me from devouring this beast.  The shake was sooo friggen good. I would go back just for a shake, but it would be hard to resist a burger. The root beer was only alright, I'm not sure I would order it again.  Overall, I was amazed. Burgers are one of my favourite foods, I'm not easily amazed by a burger, but when I am, it's so eye opening.   This is a definite must when going to Vegas (or NY)
169	1	Brought a visiting friend here for a relaxed dinner before putting her on the RedEye.  Place was packed early on a Monday, and for good reason.  Absolutely divine.  As other reviewers have mentioned the Crispy Duck Panang is perfection, though, I ordered a level "6" spice and I could have gone up a couple of notches.  Prices are totally reasonable- 2 soup, 2 entree, 4 beers came out to under $70 including tip (and we had leftovers).  Service was prompt but not rushed and very friendly.  Ambiance is somewhat lacking, but food, service and value totally make up the difference.
170	0	Worst dining experience ever. Food took forever! Partially because I ordered a burger, subbed it with a veggie patty. $3 charge for that! Uh, veggie patties are cheaper than beef. Ordered no bbq sauce no bacon (I'm vegetarian). Comes out with bacon & BBQ sauce. Send it back, comes out when my fianc is already done eating. Has no sauce, but still has bacon. Send it back...comes out 5 seconds later with no bacon. Are you kidding me?! That's a refire! You don't just take the bacon off, by health code standards you have to make a new one! Cancelled the order. Waited for the manager for about 15 min. Poor waiter couldn't find her?! Another guy comes to apologize. Free dessert. That's it! Oh, & passed the lady manager on our way out of the building smoking a cigarette...nice! Smh. The place should be out of business. Almost 11:30pm so had to find somewhere else to eat so my finance could watch me eat since he had already eaten their terrible food. Sorry. But our waiter was a good kid trying at least. I hope he gets a job somewhere else :(
171	1	Went here for lunch on New Year's Day and it was amazing! The guys who work at the counter were so friendly and provided exceptional service! For our friend he was given a small slice (which really wasn't that small), but the guy at the counter threw in a free extra slice without us even a asking! Wow! Not only that, but the guy also made sure to give me a perfect slice! Seriously, the pizza was delicious, but what really won us over was how friendly and awesome the crew are! They also found out it was my boyfriends birthday and they made sure to all wish him well and gave him a yummy dessert on the house! We will definitely be sure to make secret pizza a vegas tradition from now on!! Wonderful experience!!!
172	1	Got the meat lovers, great selection  of multiple diffrent meats and spicyness. Banchan  was good all very tasty.included sea weed salad and green salad and miso soup .  Delicious all together could have used a bit more grilled vegetables(should have ordered that side) but usually when you think of kbbq  it's for the meat anyways!!! Got some happy hour drinks flavored soju  my sister got the ginger I got the green apple. Ginger was delicious! Green apple 2 as very green apple-ey ; P place is good food for decent prices!!! Great service and located not far from the strip stop in and nom nom nom!!!
173	1	Such an expensive burger, but if you're offering an east coast exclusive restaurant on the west coast, expect people to line up. My friends and I got here right before peak dinner hour so the line was negligible.   I got the SmokeShack, it was pretty good, idk if I liked the chili peppers? I really liked the bread and how flavorful the patty was. The cheese fries were alright, kinda felt like it tasted like fake cheese (like they put on nachos) but tasted less like "fake" cheese.  The restaurant was really clean and well-ventilated! I like the ketchup and mustard dispensers, you don't have to pump it. It's more like a ketchup and mustard faucet. Lol
174	1	One of the things I love in life the most is BRUNCH! The brunch at Bouchon has to be one of the best in town- definitely the best on the strip.   They have a large assortment of fresh fruit, pastries, drinks and entrees. I really enjoyed their pastry platter (a chefs selection), and their omelette special, which was ham and English cheddar. The waiter brought over the pastries first, and explained what each one was. They gave us a sweet and savory selection, which was really nice. Both were spectacular. Another item on the menu I highly recommend are the donuts. They are covered in cinnamon sugar and served with berry compote, vanilla, and chocolate sauces. A little decadent for breakfast but for brunch, I'd order 6!  Overall, this place has a magnificent ambience, great service, and wonderful food. Their something on the menu for the savory brunch lover, the "I'm actually gonna order lunch for brunch" guy, and the sweet tooth! Gotta try it at least once.
175	0	So my family went to Vegas to celebrate my daughter's birthday. Of course this is the perfect place to sing to her. I'm willing to spend $200-$300 for our family. We came in and it was 100 degree outside, we were all tired and hungry.  Then this family came and cut in, this lady ( the mom) cut in with a straight face and didn't even care cause she knows she's doing it on purpose. My husband told her husband we were in line but I said to him it's ok cause they were only party of 3 and we have 6 in our group anyway. Then I told my husband, "just be grateful your not married to that kind of woman." And the husband heard, the husband and her kid was embarrassed by that woman's attitude. People, don't embarrass your family just for a table! Anyway, so we got our table....our waitress asked what we want for a drink, I gave her our order and I said that's all and I said "That's all"....and she said, "that's all you are going to order". And I'm thinking for a drink "yes". She left and I saw her whispering to another waitress, and I'm like..... hmmmm???? Then I came close To her register and asked to sing for my daughter, so she said to order a desert, so I did and she  brought the sundae with a candle and DIDN'T even sing to my daughter.... She just left it on our table. So we just sang to my daughter, just us!!!! How RUDE!!!! Our waitress is this black lady, that looks like a unemployed stripper/semi retired prostitute. And she's also too slow!!! Then we were waiting to order, looking at their yummy looking food. And we can't understand why she's taking too long to come back. After 30 minutes she came back with a receipt!!!! WTF!!!!! There's six of us and we only ordered drinks and you thought that's all we're ordering!!!! Dumb waitress!!!! We're celebrating my daughter's birthday!!! Anyway we were so pissed that we just decided to leave. This place is understaff..... their sundae are too sweet, the frozen chocolate drink that everyone is talking about is too grainy. YuKkk!!! And they have one dumb black waitress that needs training. I can't believe I didn't check her name. The other waitress seem nice and faster. But she's just too slow and obviously this place is under staff. They overcharge people and their understaff. Ridiculous!!!! Never will I come to this place again!
176	0	I just got back from Vegas and had a great time at Tao - nice decor, beatiful people, and fun with friends. However, (this applies only to guys)why I give it such a low rating is that their bouncers and dress code are so whacked. If you look like you're too casual, even with a button down short sleeve shirt, they'll turn you away. If you're wearing brown shoes (Steve Madden), they'll also turn you away. If you don't tuck in your shirt (guys), they'll turn you away. WTF is up with that? Our groups of guys had to go back to the room, change shoes and shirts to go back and wait in line again...I think it's just ridiculous...who goes with tucked in shirts to a night club, I'm not going there for work. Oh in addition, if you go with a bunch of guys, you won't be able to get in unless you get a table/bottle service. They only allow 1:1 ratio of girl to guy or more girls and less guys in your group before they let you in.
177	0	I came here for lunch the day after my 21st and don't remember it being as spectacular as others have described. I do remember the line stretching out to Circus Circus and the variety of food being underwhelming. Definitely beats Hometown Buffet but for $20+ at lunchtime, they aren't the greatest deal on the strip, either. The quality of food seemed a notch above some others on the strip but it is definitely a bit overpriced considering the lack of variety. I would rather eat at Pharaoh's Pheast.
178	1	We love burgers! Saw this restaurant on Triple D.   We came here twice when we were in Vegas and ordered the following:  Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries (sweet flavor and good amount of chili cheese!) Kiki Burger (filled with umami flavor!) Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries (just like the name and tasted great!)  If you love burgers, and want to eat something different, get away from the strip and drive to Bachi! You will not be disappointed!
179	1	Date/Time: Sunday ~ 8:30pm Occasion:  Bachelorette party dinner Party of:  Six Ordered:  Half dozen oyster appetizer, Steak Frites, Fromage dessert Location: Cutesy Italy-like look, open spacing, nice romantic lighting.   Total incl gratuity: ~$66 pp  I am impressed.  I didn't what to think initially but there was not one item that I, or any of the other girls, ordered that we were not pleased with.  The oysters we got were an assortment but by far the best oyster would have to be the Chelsea Washington oyster.  It as though I slurped up a piece of buttery goodness.  My mouth is watering thinking of it.  If I could go back in time, I would order a dozen more of those.  My flat iron steak came with a mountain of fries.  The meat, which was medium, was SO good considering it was a flat iron steak.  The girls tasted my steak and were in love.  The endless fries were crispy and a delicious compliment.  I had a bite of the pork chop, which was amazing.  Tender, succulent, juicy...the way pork should taste.  As always, any where that serves cheese will always get me so I ended my perfect meal by ordering the three cheeses for dessert: Valle d'Aspe (sheep's milk), Mt. Tam (cow's milk) and the Onetik Bleu (sheep's milk).  They were magnificent!  I thought the prices were incredibly reasonable, service was friendly, and the food was absolutely delightful.  Would I return?  Most certainly so.    Good choice!  Job well done, Thomas Keller! :)
180	1	I was here twice in one week during a convention, the second time was greated with a welcome back, nice ot have you again.  The service was perfect, not in my face but not ignored and my water glass was never more than 1/2 empty.  As a grey haired woman of a certain age, I am honestly not used to be treated with such respect and courtesy.  And, of course, the food was great, especially the smoked beef tartare, which was outstanding.  I was also impressed with the wine recommendations.   I must compliment Mr. Teresi for his oustanding staff
181	1	This place is a MUST! BURGERS are absolutely delicious!   Kalbi burger- never knew Kimchi would taste so good inside a burger! ordered this with a fried egg. the patty was thick and the sauce was amazing!  I will definitely come back to try other things from their menu!
182	0	I went to the grab and go window.  1 star for the service, 2.5 for the food.  They don't serve hot food before 11:30am, cashier was kind of rushy and impolite, and didn't let me order nachos--even though it was 11:25am.  She didn't even register all the items we wanted to order.  Food: The donut is big and Ok. The frozen hot chocolate is meh.  Not bad if there's nothing else around, but not really worth $17.  I'll probably avoid this place in the future.
183	1	My server Alyssa was amazing. Very kind, always had a smile on her face and made sure everything was good with us. Also her manager Marc was amazing and making sure we enjoyed our service. I will definitely be returning and telling my friends about the wonderful service and food.
184	1	This place was a bit of a surprise. I was not expecting so much flavor from the basic white cheese slice. Yeah it is tucked away down some hall took my group about 20 minutes to find it. We were walking right passed it. But that single slice was worth it.
185	0	I had a fairly disappointing experience at Tao this past Friday night.  I booked a table here for my bachelorette party.  Even though we paid extra for the guaranteed main room table placement, we still weren't in the desirable table area and were pretty much in the hallway, which was annoying after paying so much extra for what I thought was one of the good tables.  The service at the table was great - we got brought in quickly, our security/ drink pourer guy was great, waitress was very friendly.    As a girl, I like to wear very high heels.  And at Tao that was no exception - I wore my 5 inch high stilettos and as usual enjoyed attempting to look like I could walk in them while drinking.  TWICE I was brought to the "drunk girl" area and told that I am too drunk, clearly cause I was stumbling in my shoes.  They made me take my shoes off, walk in a straight line, and talk to them for a bit to I was completely fine, which I was.  It was extremely frustrating that after paying a shit ton for a table to be carted off and told I'm about to get kicked out for not being able to walk in my shoes, just to twice have them confirm I'm completely fine.  There were nicer, better, and faster ways to handle that situation.  The dance floor was REALLY packed.  IMO I think it is too small as it was almost impossible to move around out there.  I would have preferred a little more room.  Also as part of the bachelorette package, I was supposed to get a cake, and the cake never came.  I complained the next morning and they sent the cake to my hotel room which was nice but it didn't arrive till after we went out for the evening which was annoying  Anyways - I would never go back to Tao, but I'm sure it's not terrible for everyone.  Make sure to wear shoes you can walk in :)
186	1	Yum!! I go to Vegas a lot for business and am always stuck in the hotels and convention centers. I look forward to the Burger Bar and always have a pleasant experience! The best thing there? The zucchini fries! The best sandwich? The salmon 'burger' on ciabatta, with sauted portobello mushrooms and spinach. Actually heavenly. I can't wait to go back!!!
187	1	Crazy Bernie is a big fan of Gordon's and puts his money where his mouth is by going into this great spot each and every time he goes to Paris LV about 4x a year. Beef Wellington just like what they make on Hell's Kitchen is out of this world. Got to meet chef Christine the first time I went soon after she won the head chef position.  Highest quality food with prices in line with quality level. When you say no to Gordon Ramsey Steak....you say no to life!
188	0	the wait was long. ordered the lobster omelette and crabcake something. wow, don't even remember, that's not a good sign. I'm particular about my crabcakes. Not too much bread crumbs, that's good, but the crab was all shredded. I'm looking for lumps! Had a mimosa, that they forgot. I don't think i need to go back ;/
189	0	- - FOOD POISON - - BAD SERVICE - - AWFUL MANAGEMENT - -  We stayed at Mandalay Bay for our Vegas trip and decided to get something to eat late night, unfortunately the only place open was Citizens Kitchen. We walked in and got seated, the server had problems taking our orders and since he thought he could remember everything without writing it down he then brought out some of the food wrong. It took them 30-35minutes to bring out the food. No one wants to wait that long for food at 2am. Five out of  six people ordered the same food and it was the Burger and let me tell you that the vacation ended right there! Every single person had the worst stomach pain and you can imagine the rest!  I asked for a refund  the following day,  the managers told me that I should send an email with my experience so they could look it over, Nick one of the managers actually tried to help and he told us that they were very embarrassed over this and would do anything to fix it so he asked for the receipt and that he would refund the money, until today I only received $45 out of almost $180, they couldn't even track our bill and refund the rest being that they have an advanced POS system. It took them 3 weeks to refund the $45 while I had to text and call everyday.  Two of the five  people that had food poisoning  actually went to the doctors the day after and were told that it was 100% food poisoning.  Save yourself some time  and pain, do not  go to this place. It has awful food and service. I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!  - - - FOOD POISONING IN VEGAS ON YOUR 1st DAY OF VACATION, HOW MUCH FUN IS THAT - - -    Manadalay Bay should seriously think about renting to this place since they are inside of this hotel and getting so many bad reviews...........
190	0	Overrated and pricey!  I wanted chinese noodles but got soup instead.  The mexican dishes were very bland.  I immediately got a stomach ache from the food.  Paid close to $90 for four small plates for dinner.  My feelings hurt more than my tummy.  Gave this two stars because the service was good at least.
191	0	To put it briefly: we paid $98 for a dinner that left me wishing we'd just hit the Chipotle down the hall in the mall. I don't mind paying Las Vegas strip prices when the food is good, but this was a huge disappointment.  The service was fine but the food was some of the most mediocre stuff I've ever had - and I'm not usually picky.  I'm not sure how one manages to make bad potato skins, but they did. For entres we had the ahi tuna salad and the steak and eggs. The eggs were watery (how do you make watery scrambled eggs? I don't know, but they managed that too!), the tuna salad had four tiny pieces of tuna that were chewy and the greens were utterly tasteless. I also ordered a lemon drop cocktail which tasted like someone mixed a small amount of liquor in some watery blue kool aid.  Needless to say, we didn't bother with dessert.  If you're getting food around here, either go cheap and hit the food court or go to the Gordon Ramsay place where you'll pay the same price and actually enjoy your meal.
192	1	Mouth. Watering. Pizza.   I can't tell you how good this pizza is. It's a great combination of salty and cheesy goodness. I always get either a slice of their mushroom pizza or white pizza. Their mushroom pizza is delicious + a little bit of added chili flakes makes the saltiness of the pizza all come together for a flavorful bite. Their white pizza is probably one of their more famous pies and with good reason, it's delicious! It's a mozzarella (and parmesan?) based slice topped with ricotta cheese. At first, I thought it would be too much cheese for my liking but it all somehow comes together as cheesy goodness.  Now, the crust...it's all about the crust!! The pizza itself is thin with a slight crunchy bite to it. The crust is crispy but with a doughy inside that I love. The slices run pretty big so it's worth the price! ($5/6) Usually all it takes is one slice for me to be done, two if I'm super hungry. I've never had to wait in a long line to place my order (my wait is usually like 5 mins) but I've been told it can get pretty crazy late night when the clubs close.  My only complaint about the pizza is that it can be a little too oily. Seeing small puddles of greasiness is kind of gross, but nothing a pat down with a napkin won't fix. Just wish I didn't have to perform this messy task before eating it.   Seating is available inside (best for parties of 2, not so much for bigger parties) & all around the lounge type area but it can be difficult to find an open space during a busy night. The pizzeria itself is located on the 3rd floor of Cosmo, down a hallway across from the escalators.
193	1	i have been coming here for the last 8 years or so.  i first heard of LOS in a gourmet magazine article and had to try what the craze among all the food critics was all about.  from the first time i ate there till the um-teenth time, it never disappoints.  i always stop by for lunch when i'm in las vegas.  i've enjoyed almost everything i've tried here...don't forget to try some of the northern thai items...the northern style larb and pork stew is especially good.  then finish the meal off with coconut ice cream and the coconut sticky rice with fresh mangos.  N.B. if you go for lunch, do not get the buffet.  you've been warned ;-)
194	0	First off, this hotel is GHETTO!!! I came here to enjoy a juicy burger and check out hot skanks, this was the wrong place to go. The parking structure is insane! its so tiny and awkwardly designed, you can barley drive your car through it! consider yourself lucky if you happen to find parking. The elevators from the parking structure to the hotel/casino were semi-working. I got inside the death trap and it began to shake aggressively, stopped for a few seconds them shook again and proceeded to the main floor. Once inside the casino, it was filled with old white men, JUST men! and a few 60 something year old cocktail waitress'. I got to the restaurant, and to my surprise ALL the Hooters girls looked like something out of the Hills Have Eyes! the only hot waitress i spotted was like 7 months pregnant!.....ew. We ordered our food, 10 min go by....20 min go by....30 MINUTES go by.....ummm where the fuck is my burger? i asked my server what happened to our order, and she says "oh, umm you have to wait, the food always takes a long time" (we ordered a burger and a salad, nothing more!) after 40 minutes, i told her to cancel our order and close our beer tab. She says "ok, BYE" didn't even call a manager over or anything. VERY unprofessional.
195	0	Service sucked we came here two nights in a row after going out so it was prob close to 4 am.  We were the only people eating there both nights on a Sunday and Monday and our food took forever everyone who worked there was rude.  We only went again on Monday because it was the only thing open at Planet Hollywood and didn't feel like searching anywhere else out!  Food was ok when your super tired and hungry but we were so annoyed by the staff it wasn't worth it.  Def don't go!
196	1	DEFINITELY WORTH THE DRIVE We found our way here by accident last year and made a point of going back this year. Everything is delicious that we have ordered. Pork carnitas skillet was perfection. Apple cinnamon pancakes were delicious as was the often-mentioned banana nut muffin. Come hungry or share...they are generous with their portions.
197	1	Absolutely amazing! The place was busy but we were still seated right away. We didn't have to wait at all for our food. Our banana nut muffins were so fresh they were still warm. We all got different things off of the menu and liked everything we had. Lisa was our waitress- she was very friendly, and very efficient.  We will definitely stop here again when we visit vegas!
198	0	Don't get fooled by the name or television references. Serendipity's is just famous for its name and their food is quite awful (and very overpriced.) If the food actually had some flavor to it or was ACTUALLY COOKED, the price would be worth it. My friend and I ordered the mac and cheese, hamburger slides, and the famous water-tasting like frozen hot chocolate. The food was not cooked and the frozen hot chocolate tasted like it was ran down with water, which I think was the case. The macaroni noodles were super hard because they were undercooked and the hamburger patty was blood-red inside. How gross. Even if you want to check this place out and try the frozen hot chocolate, make sure to get a small as it is enough for 2-3 people. They trick you by asking would you like one for one person or however many people are in your party just to empty your pocket. It was definently not worth a 45 minute wait in the hot, sticky weather in vegas.  P.S. Don't wear one of your favorite shirts here. I don't know what is wrong with their tables but if you push down on the table with your elbow or hand while you are dining, your table will tilt and your food and drinks will go everywhere. While we were eating, the people next to us put their elbow on the table and their water cups flew into the air and spilled everywhere. Funny thing is, 5 minutes later I was getting up to go to the restroom and put my hand on the table to get up and the next thing you know, my cup of iced cold water spilled all over me and onto the floor. On my way to the bathroom, another party had a water spill which proved that the customers aren't clumsy, their tables are bad! My point being is, don't wear your favorite outfit here.
199	1	While I base my culinary life on David G.'s teachings, I must have been there on a good night or had a little Vegas luck left over because I had an amazing experience! He's right- the place has pretty much nothing English about it and is a two story glass box, but I did like the welcome; upon approaching the Host desk, you are greeted by a half dozen Identical 6 foot tall brunettes in the same little black dress. I thought I'd wandered onto a Robert Palmer video set! (lf you haven't heard of him you betta ax somebody!). We were then escorted upstairs to a rail side table overlooking the bar and entrance areas as well as a spectacular  chandelier- type lighting fixture. Very well appointed room and tables.  WHEN YOU GO- We started with the gnocchi and fried oysters. Both were very good with the oysters being my favorite. Perfectly crisp and juicy at the same time, I could have had three plates of those and been very happy. I also had the filet, which was the best I've ever had and I've had a few steaks. I usually order either a rib eye or Porterhouse, but was advised to try the filet by our outstanding server Mathew. And he was right! Perfect medium rare, juicy and flavorful to the last bite, it was incredible. Wifey had the Wellington which was very good, but I found the sauce to be a little salty and the philo didn't stand up to it very well. Good flavor and the meat was perfectly done. We also had the toffee bread pudding and if I could change one thing about the meal it would have been that. I'm not much of a bread pudding fan but after Matthew's home run with the filet suggestion, I followed his lead on this one. Very sweet, and the bread was saturated to the point of nearly being mush. I'll be going for the apple tart next time (my wife wins again!). All in all a five star experience for me. Hope it is for you too!
200	0	This place was horrible !!!   Please never go there It is a scam!! Overpriced and server Rio was extremely rude when I questioned about our receipt! He overcharged us, I came here with my family to enjoy spring break and made this awful choice to come here !!! Will never forgive myself for wasting money on this disgusting place
201	1	From the owners of Cheesecake Factory this place is delicious. I'm a gym rat and I was surprised to see many healthy options. Even offering a side salad instead of fries at no extra charge. I ate there twice at my stay at the palazzo. For lunch I had the grilled chicken avocado sandwich which was very good and for breakfast the fried chicken and waffles tickled my fancy.  Everything was presented and prepared very well. Service was good and prices are average for what you would pay on the strip. Large portions too! I will be back.
202	0	We decided to try Treasure Island buffet as we had received a complimentary coupon from the hotel. I was famished when we arrived, and still, the food was just about inedible. Meats tasted frozen and had very cheap, been sitting around under the heating lamps  for ages, quality to them. We found a hair on our plate. The only redeeming quality, hence two stars and not one, was the dessert bar where the items were not completely horrid and inedible. Staff was pleasant enough. Will likely never come back - free coupons or not. Stay away if you prefer food that tastes fresh and edible.
203	0	Would never go here again. The hostess said it was a 30 minute wait for an outside table & the place wasn't even half full, there were empty tables everywhere including outside. The "mug" drinks were way overpriced, came in a tiny plastic cup & barely had any booze in them. The bartender less friendly then a rabid porcupine. We waited for 20 minutes & NEVER saw a waiter which means we also never got to eat because we became tired of waiting & left. The only semi redeeming quality was the atmosphere, which was pleasantly quiet for a few minutes but after which it became frequently punctuated Every other minute by a loud, obnoxious, mumbled, unintelligible voice screaming some ridiculous crap about something going on in the restaurant.  That was our cue to split & look for a place that would actually be happy to serve us.
204	0	If i could rate Cabo Wabo a negative score I would.   We arrive just in time for Karaoke, which I would give 5 Stars.  But that's where the good ends.   We were not actually sat by the hostess just pointed toward the tables. No menus, so I'm assuming the frat boy waiter assumed we didn't want service. When I asked for menus he looked at me like I was nuts. Then 5 seconds after getting the menus he asked us, "so are you gonna order something?" Really?  He never asked us if wanted drinks, I went up to the Bar to get mine. For a weak 8 oz margarita it was TWENTY DOLLARS!!!! For a pre-made Slurpee with house alcohol!!     I would never go back there again. They treated us like trash and we did nothing to deserve it.   And to top it off I accidentally left an expensive souvenir behind, when I returned they didn't have a lost n found they said "we just throw it away". I tried to express the whole experience to the manager, his response was "oh well".   WOW - worst service EVER!
205	0	Worst buffet I have been to in Vegas. Very old and cold food. The best thing was the dessert and even that wasn't great. The creme brle was just vanilla pudding. Very, very disappointing. I would rather eat fast food. Highly suggest going to another buffet.
206	0	I went here with 9 other people for Memorial Day weekend.  I've been to the NY one which I absolutely loved and was really excited to know that there's a Serendipity much closer to me now.  First thing I noticed was that they have a window by the side of the building from which you can order to go.  I found it really interesting and convenient that they did that.  Although there were long lines, they seemed to be moving rather quickly.  I have to say though, I was really disappointed by my experience with the Vegas Serendipity.  Their service sucks.  When I went to get a table, they told me the wait would be about an hour.  That's understandable and fine.  After 50 minutes of waiting, my friend suggested that we check to see how far along we were.  We go up to the bitchy hostess and she informed us that they had called us.  But our beeper never rang!  And we were waiting right outside their door the whole time.  Another server then explained to us that some of their beepers were broken and said that they'd clear a table for us immediately.  Which was nice except the extra little comment she had to add which was "You guys are lucky we'll clear a table for you now".  My friend and I just looked at each other astonished.  WTF?!  The beeper issue is not our problem, it's the restaurant's.  They shouldn't be so cheap and use beepers that are broken.  Still, we didn't let that damper our mood.  We went on our merry ways and ordered a load of food.  (Their menu, compared to the NY branch, is not as long and may differ a bit)  I shared an omelette with a friend and ordered the Forbidden Broadway Sundae for myself.    The omelette was plain but decent.  Nothing worth talking about.  The sweet potatoe fries that came with it were really good but not so much after you take it home as leftovers.  When our waiter was taking down our orders, he had made it a point to ask me whether I had wanted my dessert after or with my entree to which I replied after since I didn't want to the ice cream to melt.  For some reason, my dessert was brought out with my entree.  When I told the guy that brought it out, he proceeded to give me attitude and told me "Well it's already here.  If I were to bring it back, it'll take another 20 minutes.  But I mean... I could bring it back if you really want."  I told him it was ok and he just rushed off.  No apology, no empathy, nothing.  Whatever.  I had a great dessert piled with whip cream that I had asked to be left out.  Oh well.  What could I have done at that point?  Overall, it wasn't worth it.  The food for the most part is mediocre (my friend told me the One-Eyed Jack was bad and that the bread was so hard it was inedible) and the prices are high.  If you want to go just to say you went, then go.  Otherwise, avoid it.  There are a bunch of great buffets (Wynn!) you can hit up in Vegas.
207	0	Stay away!!! Being from the Pacific Northwest, I am a bit of a seafood snob. But the prawns they served were putrid. The chicken thighs were overcooked. As were the garlic Sirloin. Vastly overpriced! Just not worth the $125 for 2. And they give you a coupon to show you how much you are saving. What a joke. One of the most unpleasant dining experiences I have had in years.
208	1	The best burger I have eaten in my life at Gordon Ramsey's BurGR. Besides very simple, but quiet amazing menu, everything in this restaurant was done right, from the amazing dessert shakes to waitstaff uniforms. Simple, tastefully stylish and delicious. Gordon is not only a top chef, but a smart businessman. Thumbs up!
209	0	This Westin has slipped. We always stay there for Furniture Market because the parking is free and very abundant. It also has the Heavenly beds which I love and a Starbucks in the lobby. Yeah! But something has changed and service has slipped. I'm not sure we will stay there again despite the fact that we are Starwood preferred members.   My room had very spotty air conditioning which was important since it was 107 degrees. So I called down to get someone to come fix it...yada yada yada...he comes...says he's fixed it. Temp doesn't change. Finally fall asleep exhausted from the day...hot and sweaty in the not-so-heavenly bed. Then the next day their solution is to move me....I don't want to move all my unpacked stuff to another floor from my colleagues one day away from leaving. She sends guy again. This time he discovers that he's left a critical part off the air co causing the air not to flow. Then it works wonderfully. Other issues...floor not swept or vaccuumed any day we were there. Trash left out in room....not "subject to interpretation" trash but things like crumpled paper and little creamer carton from the very very weak starbucks in room coffee.   Anyways....nothing was tragic...life is too short to get too worked up...but it does seem that there has been a dramatic shift since in the past it has been such a nice experience.
210	1	Glad we set aside the time to dine in here while in Vegas. Had the garlic prawns ( so good I ordered another order after finishing the first plate), drunken noodles with soft shell crab, tom khai soup, curry duck were all excellent. You see any celebrity pics with the owner echo is cool to see. Lots of world renowned chefs all cosign this place and for obvious reasons.  Also, service was great. Very attentive and courteous. I will return and would recommend anyone who enjoys Thai food to make the trip out to this part of town.
211	1	I ate here on the evening of December 26th with my family, and it was fantastic!! The great customer service started before we even got there! Our reservation (get a reservation by the way) was for 5:15pm, but we were still gridlocked in traffic on Sahara at that time. I called the restaurant to see if our reservation could be pushed back until 5:45pm. The hostess said she would hold our table until we arrived!  Shortly after we arrived we were seated at our table in the center of the restaurant. Our waiter was the best! He was very personable and explained the IPAD drink ordering menu to us. He then wheeled the meat cart over to us, so we could pick out our steaks (the meat cart is indescribable, you'll have to look at the photos) We ended up ordering the seafood platter for 4 as an appetizer, split the rib eye steak and lobster tail, and had the creamed spinach and Mac and Cheese on the side. Everything was delicious and the portions were generous. We didn't have room for dessert! We'll just have to get the sticky toffee pudding next time. We'll be back!!!
212	0	Landed at Hooters by way of www.hotwire.com, selecting a 3 star hotel in the South Las Vegas strip area.  I don't know the exact definition of 3 stars, but what we got was essentially a rundown Motel 6 with very poor service.  The hallways smelled bad, and the carpet throughout was dingy and stained.  Decor is cheap and the building looks very old.  At the restaurant, we got fooled by a breakfast buffet on the menu that magically becomes a "champagne brunch" on weekends for $3 more.  Management was minimally concerned when we took issue with the surprise on our bill.  Most of the offerings were stale and hard to bite into.  The bar by the pool carded my wife for a diet coke, which she was forced to return to the pool chair for.  I understand the concept of getting what you pay for, but I wouldn't have paid even $50 a night for this experience.  I will never return - it made the trip a disappointment.
213	0	Sat down as a party of 11.  I understand the service is going to be sluggish for such a large party, but we waited about half an hour before they took our order. Waited another 45 minutes before our food got here only to eat the worst lobster Mac and cheese I've ever had in my life. Sun dried tomatoes overpowered the rest of the flavors, and the lobster that was peppered here and there was slightly dry. The cheese was watery and reminiscent of Kraft's cheese mix. I ended up mostly mooching off of my friend's buttermilk pancakes which were 14.50 and basically IHOP pancakes (they were solid pancakes, but 14.50?). Portobello burger was also disappointing. So many regrets. So. Many. Regrets.
214	1	We went here on a Friday morning and we had attentive service. I've also went to egg works, but I actually liked the food better here even though they're all owned by the same people.  I got the stuffed French toast. It's French toast stuffed with eggs, cheese, and your choice of ham, sausage, or bacon. They also have turkey bacon. It also comes with a side of potatoes. I got the homemade orange juice again. It was really delicious but I couldn't eat it all. Afterwards, my waiter said they can do half portions! :)   My other members got burritos and stuffed French toast. They were gobbled up and said they were good.  We also got to claim the free muffin - it was moist and delicious!
215	0	Screw Planet Dailies....  My experience??? Horrible and all the people with me would really agree...  We came in really late...ok I get it but this is Vegas and there was no one else in there so there really was no need for us to wait a half an hour to get some water...that is just horrible service. Then the food took ages...Seriously a sandwhich and some ramen does not take that long to prepare...The food is mediocre at best and the service is just horrible. Perhaps it is better during the day but I wouldn't know just dont ever go after clubbing or bar hopping you will likely die of hunger and thirst before your waitress takes your drink order.  Despite the bad service we tipped well considering the time...but I will not go back.
216	1	Unlike most of the places I review on this blog, Burger Bar is a place I can write a review on based strictly on memory. Still, given the opportunity a few days ago to stop in there for lunch I didn't hesitate. Besides, I didn't have any quality pictures to post until that point.  Because I've been here so many times I was almost nervous that I would give this restaurant preferential treatment, but since I've been taking a way more analytical approach to my burgers lately I found that Burger Bar wasn't quite the perfection I remembered it.  But it was still close.  Located in the elusive Mandalay Place shopping area connecting Mandalay Bay and the Luxor, Burger Bar is placed amongst overly expensive clothing stores, men's shaving boutiques and some other more touristy shops of late. The restaurant has been there for quite a few years now and is maybe looking slightly dated, but it's still a good atmosphere. It's very open pretty much anywhere you sit, even in the booths, so don't go there if you're looking for a decent amount of privacy. Also if you're going on the weekend, or even potentially during a weekday lunch, expect a wait or try the bar.  Other than a small selection of slightly overpriced burgers, the menu is pretty much do-it-yourself. You have your choice of meats; Angus, country natural, Kobe and buffalo, along with chicken, salmon turkey and veggie if you're into that sort of thing. While the Kobe is totally delicious, I find it to be a bit expensive and have been completely happy ordering the Angus. But more on that shortly. Once you've chosen your meats, you have a very long list of choices for veggies, cheeses, meats, sauces and plenty of other fancy things. I've had quite a few different burgers over the years, and all of the toppings have been great.  For this particular meal I went with the Angus, Swiss cheese, and mushrooms on a sesame bun. Fairly simple, but that's fine because the meat always stands out as a great flavor on its own. One of the biggest things I can say about this restaurant is that however you order your burger it will always come out that way. Consistency is key, and they never disappoint. I ordered medium-rare, and it's as pink as it could be. And like I said, the meat really has great flavor, so whether you have a ton of toppings or almost none, you're guaranteed a great burger. After eating a lot of others around town lately, I could say that this burger might be lacking a bit of seasoning now, almost as if the burger is outdated like the restaurant. Still it is fantastic and won't disappoint.  The various buns I have had are always good, no matter which one you get there seems to be a proper meat to bun ratio. The mushrooms were flavorful, and just the right amount. My cheese was melted as always, the lettuce and tomato on the plate were also very fresh. I haven't always been a fan of pickles in the past, but they're growing on me with all these burger meals so now it's a welcome sight on my plate.  The fries are the one slight weak spot in this meal; my skinny fries were just ok, a bit too generic for such a fancy menu. The sweet potato fries have been really good in the past, especially with some ranch, although it's been a while since I've had them. I'm not always a fan of fat fries, but they're a little better here so you might want to try them when visiting.  My burger, fries and drink came to almost $19; I would consider that a bit on the high side if it wasn't in a very touristy spot on the strip. I'm not always too happy about spending that much on a burger meal anywhere, but compared to Bradley Ogden or even BLT this is a huge value for the same price. This place is still one of my favorite choices in town based on the burger alone, so do yourself a favor and check it out.
217	0	Never again. We had two free vouchers so we went for lunch and I'm so glad that I didn't have to pay for this meal. They had seafood, Asian, Indian, Mediterranean, and different meats as well as a variety of desserts.  We tried a little of almost everything and our tastebuds were bored at best.    I would not come back to this buffet unless it was free again.
218	0	Its true what they say, "you get for what you pay for".  From the start of our visit, the room was dirty.  The bathroom was obviously used, bed was undone, there was beer cans in the trash, and the sink was filled with dirty water! Really!!!  I call room service which took them a good 20 minutes to get here, not to mention the other 10 to 15 minutes it took the maid to clean it.  On top of all of this, the ice machine was broken, the TV remote did not work, and there was no mini fridge.  I digress, really!!  Its true that its the cheapest of the bunch, but come on, really?!!  I caution everyone before they book a room here.  It would of been nice if they comp the room for us or at least give us another room.  Oh by the way, i'm still waiting for the engineers to come to my room and fix the TV/remote control.  Been waiting 20 minutes now.  Only nice thing about this place, is that its right next to the monoreal which drops you of on the strip.
219	1	My husband and I went there on 2/19/2014, our last "full" night in Vegas this past trip.  I always wanted to try it but noticed it was rather pricey so I wanted to see what the consensus was before dishing out big bucks.  It was well worth the price though that's for sure.  We are already thinking about what we are going to order the second time around.  Our waiter was Dennis, don't recall the assistant's name but they were both nice.  We did wait a little bit though, which if the prior reviews didn't boast about the excellent service I probably would not have noticed and would have chalked it up to them being very busy.  Prior reviews were correct about the bread selection- all very good.  The salt on the butter was the BOMB!  We skipped appetizers and opted to save room for dessert.  My husband ordered the bone-in rib eye and I had the American rib cap.  For our sides we selected the mac/cheese and the truffle fingerling potatoes.  Let me just say- I could have just had the sides as my entree because they were both excellent.  Rich and decadent.  I almost felt guilty eating them.  But they were so good.  And let me say the day after they were just as good.  The American Rib cap, which I never heard of before, was excellent.  8 ounces seemed small but it was packed with flavor and with the sides, well I couldn't finish it.  That too tasted good the day after.  My husband's rib-eye although BIG was just alright.  Meaning we've had bone-ins before.  His had a little more gristle than we prefer so he's thinking he'll go with the rib cap next time.  For dessert, we went with the sticky toffee pudding even though I was a little reluctant after trying the one at BurGR- it was a little too sweet for my taste.  But the one here, at the steak place, was excellent.  It wasn't too sweet at all.  We are ready to go back on our next trip.
220	0	God bless the union. All the bartenders here are total jerks, and i would love to use a much more colorful word. This would be 1 star, but mike at le bistro bar was a sweetheart.. god, what i wouldn't give for a union pour card. Seriously, the majority of the bev staff need a major attitude adjustment.
221	0	Food was good 4 stars, the hostess Dana was a witch and needed an attitude adjustment. When a customer asks for a booth and you have one open sit them there even if your server is being double sat. Don't give them crap for their request. They are your CUSTOMER. They make your job possible like my clients make my job possible.
222	1	Hash House represents one "reel" of my foodie jackpot winnings in Vegas. Absolutely love this place!  During a mere 5 minute wait at 9ish am,  I checked out the celeb wall of fame. Man vs. Food's been here.  Impressive but more so, I loved the friendly attitude and commitment to customer service here.  Of course, the food was kickass and doled out in manly man sized servings. There must be a prereq to working here.  You must be fun and ubercool. There was no shortage of interesting tats and off the chart hair color.  Regardless, the hostess and the servers were really nice.   There was a literally a slight "mixup" in my oatmeal order but no biggie.  The server and the kitchen manager (?) were very considerate.   Yes, I actually ordered oatmeal despite being surrounded by foodie heavenly delights which were beckoning my name.  However, I resisted.  Well, no, actually, I did succumb to temptation and took a taste or two of hub's Fried Chicken eggs benedict.  Woman vs. food and food won. Now, this is no ordinary or traditional eggs benedict.  This was the kitchen sink gourmet version over yummy biscuits.  Each presented with a nice sharp knife on top of a huge pile of food.  How fitting.  My oatmeal was very satisfying with a pile of beautifully presented fruit on top. Think oatmeal... Carmen Miranda style.  Kiddo's pancake was the size of a Frisbee.  He ate a hole in the middle equivalent to 2 ordinary sized pancakes.   I know it's not "manly" to share dishes, but if you come in a group, it's too hard to not want to try someone else's entre, so I would recommend family style ordering.  The ambiance is laid back, modern and all walks of life come here.  Cool.... We'll def be back next time we're in town!!!!
223	0	The food is good but the restaurant is sneaky with its prices. Along with my entree I had one 12 ounce glass of plain, unsweetened, unflavored regular iced tea and it was $4.99!! Would have had to sit there a long time to get $4.99 worth of refills, but I had a show to see.  Unfortunately it goes along with other reviews referring to them asking if you want rice and then charging $7 for a small bowl of plain, white rice. Too bad they have shady pricing because the food tastes pretty good and I would have added it to my list of repeats, just not worth the Price Gouging you get.
224	0	I value my abilities to move and breathe. Highly value. I simply could not handle this place when it was so crowded.  This place may be all find and dandy for some people. A lot were enjoying the DJ and the 'dance' floor, but there were only a few corners here and there where you can actually interact with anyone. While trying to find a place to stay and drink we were shoved away by security saying we were too close to the elevator doors, when it's the only place to stand.  So what did we do? We left and found someplace else. I know it may be unfair since different clubs have different atmospheres, but I just found this place to be nothing but uncomfortable chaos. People pack the smoking balcony not just to smoke but because they needed rest from squirming their way across a 50 foot room.  Tao Nightclub was just not my cup of tea at all, unfortunately. I hope others enjoy it more than I did.
225	0	This place is very very over hyped in my opinion. Came here because most of the buffets in Vegas had already cut off their lines and my friends have been wanting to give it a try. The dining wait was about 45 minutes and by this time, we were all already too hangry to wait so we ordered in the outside togo/patio area instead.   I got myself a bacon cheeseburger and fries. My burger was very bland and had no flavor at all. The meat wasn't even juicy, just dry. :( The fries were mediocre at best. I did try some of my friend's frozen hot chocolate (which is what they're famous for), and it was probably the best thing I had.   Probably best to only grab the frozen hot chocolates here!
226	0	Went here last weekend for my honeymoon. What a disaster of a buffet! $30 dollars for food that tasted like it had been prepped a week in advance and over nuked in a microwave. This is the WORST buffet I have ever ate at. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY when you go to Vegas. Can't say it enough...bad...Bad..BAD!!!
227	0	I went to lunch around 3pm with no line. Awesome right? Anyways the food was ok. Decent. Better than hometown imo but my gripe is the staff. My server sucks. Never once did she ask if I wanted a refill on my drink and my plates were stacked 4 high...  I had to complain to the floor manager Anthony. He apologized but still the lack of professionalism had caused me to have an awful experience. Don't know if I would go back.  If I do it would ve because of the floor manager
228	1	If you are in Las Vegas and you are looking for a good and filling breakfast, try this place. I had eggs benedict with spinach, delicious! My friends had french toast which came in a big portion and were very good. Prices are ok, and lower compared to the places in the strip (this place is 15 minutes from the strip). Definitely recommended.
229	0	It sounds like a lot of people like the French Onion soup. Well, on the contrary, my cousin wasn't satisfied with his French Onion Soup at all. He took about 3 sips and gave up on it. I don't know if he's just picky, it was a bad day for french onion soup, or it's really just not that great.   I ordered the turkey pot pie. POT PIE? I love pot pies. I think it was the special of the day, so I gave it no second thought and ordered it. The first thing I thought to myself upon seeing my pot pie was, "UMMMMM, is this the right order? This looks like a croissant wannabe over a well of pea and turkey soup." Okay, I might be describing it worse than it actually is. Check out the picture I posted and judge for yourself. The presentation was nice, but wasn't at all how I imagined it. I dug into the puff pastry hoping to find lobster, but it was just more...puff pastry. =[ Boy was I bummmmmmmed. If only all the peas and turkey bits were INSIDE of the puff pastry..it didn't even taste that great, hence the 2 stars.   I won't come back unless I'm really hungry at night and everything else is closed-why? It's open 24/7.
230	0	Once was enough for me. I am not coming back.  Not only is the service terrible, but the food is vastly overpriced, even for the strip. I waited about 40 minutes for ONE very simple, yet expensive dessert. I expected the quality to at least be great, but it was sightly above average at best. Nobody in my group was impressed.  In addition, a few of my friends recently received melted ice cream from this place. For a restaurant that is known for its desserts, that is unacceptable. Never mind, that should be unacceptable everywhere!  Satisfy your sweet tooth somewhere else.
231	1	I was in joy when seeing the sign while wandering around with the bf.  we're seated immediately at the comfortable table. As usual, I did the ordering, and my eyes are always bigger than my stomach.  We had chicken and waffles which was something different to try, but tasty,  steak sandwich - very good, fried calamari with rock shrimp - an excellent dish, salad & soup combo which was nothing special, we didnt  even finish half of it. However, each portion was way bigger than I thought. For the drink, my bf had beer, while I got orange & strawberry smoothie in a big glass was super good that I kept drinking instead of eating food, but still couldnt finish, therefore I had to ask my bf to suck it up 'cause I didnt want to waste it.  I love the service here, my waiter was nice, friendly & attentive, he came by few times to ask if everything was ok, and another gentleman which I guessed its the manager came over to check on us making sure we're well served. With an awesome service & food like this, I would love to come any time.
232	1	I love this place, it's my 4th time here and it's kinda become a tradition to eat lunch before heading back into LA. All the servers and cocktail servers are pleasant. While waiting for our table we went into the lounge and had cocktails by the fire pit. Best Bloody Mary in town, honestly! We loved our lunch today. Corned beef hash was amazing. I don't remember the lady's name who was our server, she had blonde hair, probably in her 50's? She was awesome.
233	0	We originally wanted to go eat at P.F. Chang's but it was an hour wait so we decided on this place instead.  Maybe we should have taken it as a sign that there was a reason this place had no wait.  The food is pretty expensive for the meagre size portions you get.  We ordered pad thai, potstickers, lettuce chicken wraps (I was craving this when I thought we were gonna go eat at P.F. Chang's), sweet and sour pork, and wonton soup.  They ended up bringing by a wrong order so they just let us keep it.  Service was ok but a little slow.  They never refilled our waters.  I guess if you want something quick and you're staying at Planet Hollywood then it's convenient.  Otherwise I wouldn't bother stopping here.
234	0	I visited serendipity 3 during Christmas week with my family and we expected to wait a long wait to be seated. But as went up to the hostess she greeted us horribly and in an awfully rude way she told us it would be a 45 min wait, and asked us for our phone number so she would text is when there was an opening available. She never texted us to let us know. When the next family behind us went to make their reservation the hostess greeted them in a nicely manner. After we decided to order from their outside stand, we ordered vanilla and the lady told us she ran out of vanilla but the next guy behind ordered vanilla and she gave it to him. She was also very rude about not having vanilla. We were visiting the Bay Area, California and that is all I wanted a nice experience at Serendipity like john cusack had on serendipity but no that did not happen and my first time experience at serendipity was ruined.
235	0	Like much in Vegas, pretty on the outside, but no substance.  Ate here twice on a recent business trip. The space, redecorated from its previous goofy pseudo-diner style, is quite nice, masculine and casual yet well-appointed, with a classy bar and the now-ubiquitious but still pretty old style light bulbs. Sat at the bar and had friendly and attentive service.   The breakfast was standard - eggs/toast/sausage/potatoes were like "diner plus" with a flavorful pepper mixed in with the potatoes and thick texas style toast. Fine. The major disappointment was dinner. I went in craving something just barely healthy (after a few days in Vegas I was desperate for a vegetable) and the main recommended entree at Citizens is a chicken/brocolli/potato plate that looked great. Unfortunately the execution was inexcusably poor, especially for a "signature" dish. The chicken was flavorless and dry, even with the skin left on. Broccoli rabe was undercooked and also flavorless, and the potato quarters were the least cooked of all, with a full half of them too hard to even cut with a fork, and inedible. Everything sat in a plate full of broth, perhaps that's in an attempt to disguize the dryness and blandless of the food, but even the broth doesn't help. Chow in San Francisco does this chicken/brussel sprouts/mashed potato dish that's just bursting with flavor and juiciness, and it's like 12 bucks. This $25 plate was just sad and pointless. Again, like so much in Vegas in general, it's an opportunity to spend twice as much on something half as good.
236	0	Honetly I came here at 3 in the morning (its a 24 hour location) and the line was ridiculous. Nothing but drunk people screaming at the workers and women with barely any clothes on walking around. I really felt as if I was in a nasty club with really bad lighting.   It took almost an hour to get my food, the workers looked tired, overworked, and unappreciated. I felt so bad people were yelling at them cursing them out saying mean things to them, It was really bad.   On top of that, I ordered the chicken rings and try were extremely dry and hard. The shake was about 7 dollars and not great. Overall I wont be coming back, but I hope that the people that work here can get a nice vacation some day because what they go through is atrocious.
237	0	My best friend from high schools little sister turned 21 recently so we all headed to vegas to some fun.  They all booked rooms here based on the pool, so I went on hotwire and booked a room for my boyfriend and myself.  While hotwire is all about not telling you what the hotel is they give you a map and its pretty easy to tell which hotel you will be in.  So that was all pretty easy.  I called them and specifically asked for a smoke free room with a king bed.  That was all pretty easy and nice.  Our room was in the West Wing, which is pretty reviled on yelp and I understand why.  While nothing was super bad about our stay, some things made it not a place I would pay to stay in again: -the valet, there are like 5 entrances to the MGM by car, but only one of them takes you to the valet. WTF -the west wing hallways are seriously dark and kinda skeevy looking -no mini fridges in the room -horrible cable, they have like 7 channels and 5 of them not in english -security came and scolded my friend for leaving the door to her room open while we were in it -the rooms have absolutely no sound proofing at all. you can hear everything in the hallway and in the rooms next to you.   -$15 a day for wifi.   -no robes -i tried to move the side table closer to the bed and it was super sticky, since we had just gotten there, that was pretty gross  MGM is supposed to be nice, but they obviously put all the people who purchase rooms on the internet in lame rooms with absolutely no amenities.  If I were to ever stay here again I would have to make sure it would not be in one of these rooms.
238	0	MORE? How about a little LESS!!!  This place is disgusting. After one bite I already wanted to leave. The food taste old and had no flavor. I had to put hot sauce in my soup to get a taste.   The place didn't even look nice. It looked like a hospital cafeteria.   Waste of money. The buffet at Treasure Island tasted much better than this restaurant, if that's what you can even call it.
239	0	I came here for the first time to eat dinner with my friends and I must say I wasn't impressed. While the waitress was very friendly, it didn't make up for the lack of effort put into making the food. I decided to try their "world famous wings" since it appeared to be the most popular menu item. After a very long time waiting, my wings arrived and they were very cold. I couldn't bring myself to eat very many and just found a few that were warm.  Would I say I had a good first time? not really.  Would I go here again? probably not, ill just stick to Wing Stop.
240	0	I wish I had lower than a star for this restaurant. First, Price posted on a filet mignon was 37 while when seated, the menu showed it 39. The waiters were fine but the food was not a filet mignon but a steak. I ordered medium to well, which I always order like that but it came so dry. I wasted my money for sure. Juice 5 dollars a glass, refill is the same cost. There's apparently no restaurant manager ensuring that everyone is attended. You are on the mercy of waiters' attention.
241	0	I've been dying to check out Serendipity 3.  And yes, I did read the Yelps beforehand but since Janice C., my friend that lives in Vegas, & I still wanted to check it off our to do lists we decided to go to the To Go area outside since the hostess said their system was down to take reservations (I called ahead of time) and the wait would be around a half hour.  The To Go menu has a lot less attractive items on the menu.  The wait was still very long for bf & I to get our kobe sliders & fries.  And Janice C. who was behind us her salad came after the order of the guy behind her!  Who puts one cook in such a popular To Go window of the restaurant?!    The kobe sliders weren't bad, but $9 for 3 of them...geeze...happy hour somewhere else would have been cheaper!  The fries were alright too, wish they were a little crispier however.  I had a sip of my friend's frozen hot chocolate, it was alright, nothing special really and not worth $10!  The outdoor seating was kind of limited, but luckily there were a couple empty tables which were not tended to.  The misters could have been stronger and better aimed.    I may try to go to the original location AND eat there whenever I go to NYC, but as for this location, no thanks, it's overpriced & overrated!
242	0	First time here and everyone I know has been to this restaurant, if you want to call it that. I was hoping the reviews for this place was wrong, but sadly, they were completely right and I wish I would have listened and spared myself the $60 I spend on half assed burgers and over-priced alcoholic drinks.   First off when you walk up, it's not a restaurant, its a ghetto picnic table seating area that looks like a food truck with dinning space. Don't have the expectation of sitting at your own table, no, you sitting with random people you don't even know.   Then they give you a drink menu, with no prices! Worst thing I did was order a drink and not ask, "How much!" It ended up being $25 and too over powered with girly sugary crap of alcohol; it actually made me sick because it was too sweet!   They are rude here just FYI, that's their thing.  I had mayonnaise packets thrown at me, my burger was burnt on purpose when I asked for well done, which I thought was fucked up. The waitress humped my boyfriend for no reason and they make you where stupid paper hats that say stupid shit on them which is whatever; part of the gimmick.  Over all the food was horrible. I'd take a McD burger over that any day which is saying a lot because I am a health nut and would never go to McDonalds. The burger patty was not fresh, the lettuce was the cheap, shredded kind and wilted and the cheese was that gross off brand kind you avoid at the grocery store.   If you can, don't come here even if you want the "experience", because overall the experience is horrible. You're not missing anything here folks. Take your money, go buy a Fat Tuesday and grab a bite at Gordon Ramsey's Burgr, because let's be honest, for $60 that offer is well worth it!
243	0	I heard a lot of hype about Pink's so I was expecting some awesome hot dogs.  I was hugely disappointed.  My sister and I shared the mushroom swiss dog, the bacon chili cheese dog and a side of onion rings.  I was surprised that our order came out looking like regular hot dogs and buns (that you'd buy from any grocery store) slathered in everyday condiments.  I totally agree with the other reviews that there was really nothing special about the food here.  The mushroom swiss dog was disgustingly coated in mayo.  I like mayo but not to the point where that's all you taste with every bite.  The bacon chili cheese tasted no better than something I could have ordered at Wienerschnitzel...super salty and the chili tasted nasty like it was "fresh" out of the can.  Of all the things we ordered, the best thing was probably the onion rings but there wasn't anything extraordinary about those either.  Honestly, this place is no different than any other fast food joint except that it's highly overrated.  We actually came here after several rounds of mojitos and even then it still didn't taste any good.
244	0	The food here is horrible.  Me and my hubby came here for lunch last Saturday before I went to go shoot a wedding over at the Flamingo (which is another damn story).  The price tag was off for the food they had to offer, but there wasn't a line around 1:45, it was almost $60 for the both of us.  They didn't even have any shell fish at this price.  I hadn't been to the MGM since I was a kid and wanted to just go and see it again and try the food, which proved to be horrific.  Going up and down the aisles, I realized that a lot of the food was really repetitive, they had your fried/southern comfort food, your "asian" food, including teriyaki fish, noodles, sushi, etc.  They had their breakfast items, salads, veggies, fruits, desserts.  I'm pregnant, which totally multiplies my love for food by like umpteenth times, but before being pregnant I could take down a whole cow if you gave me a few hours, but this place couldn't even make pancakes that were appetizing enough.  I had these scalloped potatoes with cheese and sour cream, I believe, on it, and the potatoes weren't even fully cooked.  Phil had some fried chicken and fish items, which were not good.  I also had the teriyaki fish I mentioned earlier and the minute I put it in my mouth I had this overwhelming taste of ginger.  I had the couscous salad which tasted much like toothpaste.  Honestly, I can say that the only thing good about this place was the veggies, oh and the nachos, but how could you fuck up tortilla chips and cheese, but everything else was horrible.  They put such a bad taste in my mouth that I didn't even bother getting desserts and I have the worst sweet tooth, and if anything I'm sure the desserts would've put me in a better mood.  In the end, we left unsatisfied, a trip to Carl's Jr. probably would've done a better job at feeding me and my husband.
245	0	We stayed here for the NYE 2013/ 2014. When we walked into the room we found stains on the comforter and a dirty bathroom.  The day before we left no one came to clean our room.  When we came back we had to call twice and wait until close to midnight before someone came by.  The front desk was very unhelpful with the situation amd wanted to blame us for the mishap.  We will not be booking with the MGM again.
246	1	We are non locals; came here for Happy hour and we stuffed our faces for $36 total. Totally worth it.  Food:  Pork belly- flavorless Bulgogi-good Spicy Pork-awesome Complimentary side dishes lacked freshness. Environment: Clean and modern Service: Dave was an awesome server! We kept ordering more and he was friendly and patient with us.
247	1	I felt like I HAD to go here when everyone was mentioning the "secret" pizza place.  Following my fellow Yelp-ers directions, we stumbled upon this place and the smells were amazing!  I kept it simple and we got a slice of the white pizza and the regular pepperoni pizza (we had just eaten at Pink's so we were a bit full).  Brought the slices back to the hotel (mistake, btw.  I should've eaten it right away.  They're best when hot from the oven!) and devoured it.    The food was soooooooo awesome and easy on the wallet.  I definitely wanna go back!
248	1	First time here and was very impressed with the food, ambience and service. The interior is nicely designed to allow for a very pleasant dining experience. And the servers are very attentive and friendly.   The food here is delicious. This is what we ordered:  -spicy tuna kimbap -spicy soft tofu -Harami miso -Korean prime kalbi -Beef toro  -Salmon  -Korean chicken with cheese fondue  -bibimbap  The beef is very tender and soft. It just melts in your mouth! The beef toro wasn't as tender as if anticipated. The   Korean prime kalbi was delicious but I would have to say that the Harami Miso was my favorite. The spicy tuna kimbap is good but it's very heavy. It'd be wise to take it slow with that! The chicken was very soft and tender surprisingly, but the cheese part really wasn't for me. The spicy tofu soup was very flavorful and delicious. It definitely helps settle all the bbq that you just ate.   Overall, quality and and atmosphere are on point here. I would definitely come back here in the future.   ***the amount of food was for a party of 3 and it was more than enough.
249	1	Hash House a YES YES!!!  I saw the Hash House a Go-Go featured on one of the Vegas morning shows during a recent business trip and decided we would check it out on our next trip to Vegas... boy we certainly weren't disappointed. This is probably one of my top three places to go for breakfast now.  They describe the menu as 'twisted farm food', which is a good way of describing it. Everything is made fresh and it is all good. You can get a traditional bacon & eggs if you like, but if you want to be more adventurous, you can try something like the Salmon & Brie Scramble with a side of grilled mashed potatoes (yes... MASHED POTATOES FOR BREAKFAST!!! How can you not love that?!)   The various hashes are a specialty. I particularly was taken with the french toast with pecans and grilled banana. YUM! Also, the don't pass up one of their biscuits with homemade jam (they come with most meals).   All the portions were HUGEMONGUS so make sure you're hungry and don't plan on eating for the rest of the day! We barely made a dent in our breakfasts when we went there. This would be a good place to go as a group and get a bunch of different things and eat it all family style.   The service was friendly and attentive which made the experience all the more enjoyable.   This place is quite a bit off the strip on W. SAHARA, so a cab ride would probably cost a bit. Its best if you have your own transportation. I do believe the Deuce Bus goes out there also.   If you're looking for a great place where the locals go, check this place out.We enjoyed it so much we decided to go back one more time before we left town and I'm sure we'll be back again.  If you leave here hungry, you just ain't tryin'.
250	0	Good valet service.  Front desk service is horrific...especially a person named Del who argues and hangs up the phone on guests.  Bell service is terrible, they lost my bag.  It is unbelievable to me how a bag can be lost from the car to the room.  However, the Raiding the Rock Vault Show is awesome, the LVH is lucky to have it.  Having stayed there two times now, the rooms are very gross, and I had the nicest suite you could have.  The carpet is so disgusting....they brought it over from a hotel across the street.  I was told from an employee who has been there for 30 years.  They are owned right now by Goldman Sachs, and are hoping that someone buys them.  The furniture is old and disgusting.  I wonder how this hotel stays alive with all the new, shiny hotels that are available to stay at.  And the employees are not even nice.  If they were, it might make up for the poor hotel conditions.
251	1	I like hide and seek and here is a place I think I could hide forever without being found AND they have pizza! Perfect!   My girlfriends had never been in here before so I took them to the secret location and they were already in a trance by all the vintage album covers lining the wall. Once inside we discover we are the only girls so that always helps.   The guys working behind the counter were down to earth and super sweet. I ordered the slice of white pizza and they put a cold tomato on it once it comes out of the oven. The pizza guy was real cool so I think the slice was around $3 and I tipped him $7. As I am approaching cougar age I find I tip younger guys more.....First sign of a cougar, maybe? Shhh. Let's not talk about it.   Back to the pie. Hot damn that was good. I could have pounded down four more slices easily. The garlic, the cheese and the contrast of the cold tomato worked wonders in my mouth. I also tried a bite of the cheese slice with red sauce. Also dynamite.   I'm hooked on this place. I have spent big bucks on a couple of  Cosmo's fine dining restaurants and I have to say the best meal I have had came from the secret pizza place.... I will be back. Oh yes, I will be back.
252	1	I hate to admit I first came to this place because of "Anthony Bourdain no reservations." For years I've driven by this place thinking that it looks like a Vegas rendition of a Denny's. When you first walk in, the Vegas Denny's theme still holds true with one small exception. You will notice a double glass door in the back left corner that leads to the Peppermill's Fireside Lounge. The 5 stars is solely for the Fireside Lounge and not the Restaurant.  You instantly enter into a late 60's early 70's themed lounge that relaxes and surprises in the same breath. The decor looks like they actually had well kept furniture from the 70's imported through some kind of time portal and not the new furniture that is meant to look retro. I ordered the scorpion (Giant volleyball sized drink) because I saw Bourdain order it himself and our group loved it. We (my wife and myself) got it blended with the ice cream and the couple we were with got it on the rocks. Both are very tasty but I'd have to go with ice cream variety. We order the Peppermill sampler which had cheese sticks, chicken fingers, shrimp, and bruschetta to name a few. It served its purpose and tasted good but nothing too standout about it.  The service was on spot and great!! Peppermill's Fireside Lounge is a must stop if you're in the Vegas area. Great for pre/post parties or even being the main attraction.  Here's my advice to the Peppermill owners- Keep up the great job and don't change a thing!!!
253	1	It's been over 6 months since I've been out to Vegas, and to Shake Shake specifically, but since when people ask me for recommendations in Vegas, SHAKESHAKE is basically my #1 recommendation, I figured I'd better write a review! I initially heard about ShakeShack from friends that traveled to NYC, and basically it was described as a "classier In & Out" Burger.  haha, which may or may not be true.  They have different menu options, so that is what appeals to me.  As a Vegetarian I was thrilled by their SHROOMBURGER on the menu!!  It was nice to be able to have actual protein source instead of just getting to try fries & a milkshake like at other classic Burger Places.  Also, when I was there I ordered the CONCRETE-SHACK ATTACK with chocolate custard, chocolate truffle cookie dough, chunks of dark chocolate and plenty of chocolate sprinkles and fudge sauce!!  And naturally I ordered crinkle Cut french fries to accompany all this yumminess!  My hubby opted to by a pure Chocolate Milkshake as a classic, and a baseline to compare to other places.  He did think it was delicious, but after having a few tastes of my Concrete, I think he wished he would have opted for one of their specialties!  And, you can even design your own concrete, and pick the toppings to go in as well, so that is always an option if you don't want to try their Signature Concretes.  To be fair, in Vegas, there is not a shortage of burger places such as Gordon Ramsay, White Castle, Wahlburgers, Burger Bar, Fat Burger, In & Out etc.  And, I haven't been to a majority of those to be honest, so I can't really speak to what ShakeShack compares to.  But, I just figured that I'd trust New Yorker's... I figured they would know what is up with their New York-based fast Food Chain. ;-)  And, they have vegetarian choices, so that is even an extra bonus to me!!!
254	1	About my fifth or sixth visit here, has never disappointed. This time I sprung for the Kobe burger, with spinach, Bleu cheese, peppered bacon, and a red wine and shallot sauce. Burger was cooked perfectly and tasted succulent, juicy, and buttery. Loved it!  Also had the  fat fries with dipping sauces. They were very good as well. Can't wait to return when in Vegas next.
255	0	There's nothing really wrong with the cafe, for breakfast, except for the outrageous prices. $4.50 for a beverage? Give me a break. I'm willing to pay a premium price for a nice restaurant experience, but I demand better food, better service, and better/unique ambiance in return. Cafe Bellagio offers none of those for its sky high prices.   The Crab Cakes Benedict was pretty good, though not work withe $20. The plain Belgian waffles were also pretty good, but not for $10--the secret, I think, is they use a lot of vanilla.   Service was OK for a restaurant of that size. There was a wait of about 15 minutes to get a table, but that was at 10AM on a Saturday with a rush.   If it's a weekday and you insist on eating at the Bellagio, go for the buffet. Better deal, I think. Otherwise, go off strip. Your wallet and stomach will thank you--first when the bill comes, later when you have to pay it.
256	0	So my boyfriend was giving me a hard time for being a bratty princess with the need to stay at a fancy place. Ok, fine, I'll show you. I booked this hotel as a Christmas "gift" to him just to show I can stay in such "cheap" place.   And boy was this cheap, as in, cheap in every way. The room was mediocre at best. The floors had stains of god knows what and the bathroom arrangement was retarded. Only the shower and toilet was on tiled floor, the sink is outside in the carpeted area. It  was... stupid. The walls were ridiculously thin and you can hear EVERYTHING. My friend told us about his bad experience with LVH with the maids throwing away all of his stuff had me paranoid so we stuffed our belongings in drawers and closets as well as took pictures of them to make sure we have proof. Luckily nothing happened but I do not want to go through that ordeal of feeling unsafe.   My boyfriend said we're never staying here again. HA! Proved you wrong hunny and even you were appalled.   DON'T STAY HERE!
257	0	MEEEH. I really really really used to love Tao. I went last weekend and my eyes were opened to its overratedness. Don't get me wrong, its a great venue but it definitely has is flaws.   The Venue - Freakin awesome. When all is said and done, you have three levels. On the first level you have the lounge with a ton of couches and a big bar. Not many people dancing though - you also do not need to pay cover to get in here. The next level is the main club level with two separate rooms. One plays hip hop and the smaller plays "Dance". There are bars on every side. Last but not least, Tao Beach is upstairs. Seating, heat lamps, big bar, POOL - its all there. There is also so great decor - YES I DO MEAN BATH TUBS.   So that was the good, onto the bad:   The line. WOW. I get that this is a hot spot in Vegas but the line gets nuts. I have seen it wrap and twist around around the whole outside area. There is an easy fix to this - go have dinner in the amazing restaurant and get a "line pass" stamp at the end of your meal. It will fill you up, save you some time and cut the cost of cover!   The bars - can you say freakin expensive for not the greatest value. Yessir, my Henn was $16. I'm not even a Henn guy and it was still $16. LOL If your a dude, you also have to find a female bartender cause the guys will barely come talk to you if there is any type of crowd around. I almost had to flash a little areola to get a drink.   The space - yes this may be the biggest club I have ever been to but it is too effing packed. Like so packed you can't have fun. It amazes me that there aren't a ton of fights in here. I had no room to dance and less room to even walk. Tao Beach is cool upstairs but its COLD in November.   As nice as the club is, there are too many cons and spots where its easier to have more fun in Vegas.
258	1	I always get the Miyagi-San burger and truffle fries, but the porcini sauce on the fries never seems to be enough and I always have to ask for extra sauce which isn't free. I've also tried their ramen but have just decided to stick with their burgers. I really don't like paying almost 14 bucks for a burger but this is truly worth it and can't eat a regular burger anymore.
259	1	Celiac/Gluten-Free Review: A group of friends and I visited Bouchon for dessert. Knowing Thomas Keller is associated with the GF Cup4Cup flour, I knew there wouldn't be any problem finding gluten free options. It didn't disappoint! All of the staff were very knowledgeable, and I had the signature GF bouchons with garden mint ice cream. My dish came out on a special non-branded plate indicating to me that they were special plates for food allergy sufferers, so even the non-servers who brought out our food knew what was going on.  Top notch and extremely safe for Celiacs to enjoy some sweets! (If you aren't able to eat at the Bistro itself, the Bouchon Bakeries in the Venetian have giant macarons as a GF option.)
260	1	This is it!  Michael Jackson isn't the only one.  This place is so great...every aspect of it.  What carne asada fries are to drunks in San Diego and what Paisano's Pizza is to drunks in Hermosa Beach, Grand Lux is to drunks in Vegas.    The beauty of this place though is that it is for classy drunks and not even for only drunks.  The food: perfection.  They have THE BEST Chicken Parm I've ever had. They use a number of different types of cheeses that add to the tastyness of it.  They also lighly bread the chicken making it more tasty.  Unlike other places where all you taste is fried batter.  You get the flakeyness and deliciousness of the breading here with the juicyness of the chicken.  Now let's move on to the next entree...shall we?  If you order Buffalo ______ at Grand Lux, it's a safe bet to be amazing.  Anything Buffalo is good here. Their buffalo chicken roll appetizers are some of the best appetizers I've ever had and their spicy buffalo chix sandwich just adds to the buffalo goodness.  Sometimes I order both and I may get a look from the waiter recognizing my buffalo filled meal, but all that subsides after the first bite.  Now to breakfast...  I tried their breakfast buffet here for the first time 2 weeks ago, and it was $15.95 and it included juice.  Very good breakfast selection of eggs, bacon, omelette station, fruit, waffles, etc.  The only thing missing was pancakes.  What i did though was made a nice dessert out of the waffles by taking some hot waffles and adding some of the chocolate chips they have laying around and put a nice dose of whip cream on top.  And if I'm feeling good, add some fruit.  They also have hash browns, which were some of the BEST hash browns I've ever had.  They weren't dry at all.  It was just great.  The greatest part is that they have 6 cheesecake factory cheesecakes (b/c it is the same company) and a whole bunch of other awesome desserts that I am sadly usually too full to eat.  I can't recommend this place more!
261	1	Heaven!  We had an absolutely delicious meal here for my birthday!  Here is a quick rundown of each item and our overall opinions:  1) Cheese plate- fabulous and large portions of several cheeses including cow and goat.  Served with delicious grain crackers and raw honey. 2) Foie Gras- buttery and delicious, paired with toasted baguettes. 3) Steak and Frites- Delicious cut of meat, cooked to an exact medium rare and paired with a huge side of tasty fries! 4) Roasted Chicken- Perfectly crisped skin and tender meat with a savory sauce.  5) Lemon Tart- Was rich, creamy, and very well balanced.    All of the portions are huge at Bouchon and the service is outstanding.
262	1	This place is awesome.  The food is very reasonable priced and you get enough to feed 2-3 people on one item.  There is a sharing charge of $2.50.  He had the Mushroom, Sundried Tomato, Artichoke, & spinach Hash  with scrambled eggs, biscuit that had a peach jam (with actual cut peaches in it). It was delicious & ended up taking half to go, then ate some of mine.  I had the meatloaf sandwich.  OMG. The bread was a milk bread (huge thick slices toasted) with the meatloaf, cooked cheddar cheese, & tomato sauce.  The side of mac & cheese was delicious, but I suggest unless your hungry don't order it.  The sandwich was enough for 3 servings.   We sat at the bar since it was full around1:30p.m..  We noticed how they make an ice coffee while sitting at the bar, and let me say it looked yummy.    The menu is moderate, but I can say this, I will be back for something else from that menu.  If you are coming to Vegas, you need to check this place out.    Host greeted us with a smile and hello.  Food came out within 10 mins or so, bartender checked in with us constantly.
263	1	We came for dinner after a really long day and everything was awesome...perfect timing also because they have reverse happy hour! Soju  Food was delicious and service was great and attentive and food came out in a timely manner..considering the price the portions were good...Would definitely come back next time we're in Vegas! It was our best meal of the day...wayyyy better than our $60 sausage, egg and toast breakfast!!!!!!!!  lol
264	1	My families experience at Bouchon was AMAZING! Getting to the restaurant was a bit tricky, just remember there's an elevator that takes you to Bouchon in the lobby of the parking garage! Venetian has a sign leading you to the Bouchon cafe but the full restaurant is on the 10th floor...there was a couple in front of us that messed up EXACTLY like us so I didn't feel as dumb "p we arrived at the restaurant and were seated within 5 minutes. My son (1.5), daughter (4), husband and myself got sat at a 4 top and the hostess brought crayons and pages for them to color. But we realized they cover their tables in paper!!! My babies loved drawing on the table!   Our server wasn't anything special. She didn't ignore my kids and I appreciated that. We ordered orange juice and: French TOAST - HOLY COW!!! This was the best french toast EVER. You can not have breakfast at Bouchon without ordering this!! The butter it was served with i could have ate with a spoon! Steak sandwich - the bread was perfect, our steak was perfect medium, the peppers and onions gave a great texture contrast. I will be ordering this again for sure!! Beignets - they were ok at best... Cinnamon apple oatmeal- totally regret ordering this. It was crazy watery and had ZERO flavor. We added all the brown sugar and even 3 packets of natural sugar but still..yuck. Luckily my son ate some.  I loved the French Toast and steak sandwich so much Bouchon gets 5 stars and I deem it as one of the best breakfasts I have EVER had!! I literally can't wait to go back!!
265	0	NOT A HILTON ANYMORE ! Do not stay at this property. They have been kicked out of the Hilton Brand for poor performance. I had such a bad experience at this hotel that I have been keeping an eye on it. If you call the Honors Desk they will explain the situation. They deserve it too. Save your money and go stay somewhere else or you will be sorry. It is nice to see that Hilton corporate cares about its brand and gave this dump the axe. Thank you Hilton Corporate.
266	1	This wasn't on my to-do list, nor did i know of it from Rachael ray  or man vs food. Searching yelp one morning and looking for something else besides hash house and denny's / ihop / buffet i came across this.  And wow.  This place feels homey. Decor is really cool with western american style wooden tables and chairs that didn't come off too tacky . Plus outdoor seating and this place is slammed on a Friday morning? Must be a good place.   Looking through the menu, my eyes caught a special that was simply prefect. Chocolate pumpkin pancakes. The waitress kept talking them up after i ordered so i was excited but gave a negative vibe to my friend, making him feel like his dish wasn't as good ( he ordered the Mexican style omelet ). Coffee here comes in a carafe making the experience pretty top notch as coffee goes quick in my breakfast meals and i always feel like i am always trying to get more refilled.  The pumpkin chocolate mix in my pancakes was awesome and hands down the best breakfast i had in Vegas. The egg's here are epic. One side order came with a lot of bacon which looked lost in the eggs. The eggs and bacon were a course of their own.   Tried a little of the Mexican omelet it was good too.  Honestly for the cost of the meal and added experience it was a honestly my favorite breakfast throughout whole  trip. Next year I am going to come at least twice when i visit.
267	1	Great place near Mandalay's casino. The burgers are really good. I got the burger medium on ciabatta with an egg and jalapeno bacon. Super delicious! The onion rings were also really good - cooked perfectly. I love the customized burger and am craving to go back!
268	0	went here for a "good " breakfast. I ordered the chicken fried steak. yeah...my "steak" was ground beef cooked in a ton of oil. the potatoes are packaged not fresh prepared. the sausage was pre frozen and pre cooked. I really doubt the fresh made "buttermilk" biscuits were fresh nor buttermilk. sorely dissapointed especially for the price. asked for a discount for the "steak". they took 7 bucks off so thats good but dang it...how do you make a bad breakfast!???
269	0	Very disappointing!  A local friend said to come here and it was a bad choice. Menu selection very limited and food is below average. We ordered the $25 diablo sampler for the appetizer and calimari was nasty, wings and potato wedges were good but can get same quality at favorite sports bar for 1/2 the price and the rolled taquetos were below avg...we asked for our check and left before making a bigger mistake in ordering an over priced main cource. Wouldn't waste your money!
270	1	Had breakfast at Bouchon after finally finding the place in the terribly confusing Venetian (and we've been to the casino many times).  My wife had the waffles with strawberries and vanilla syrup.  I had the sourdough French toast with bread pudding.  This was the best breakfast we have ever had bar none!  What we cook at home as waffles and French toast seem like totally different foods!  Service was good though perhaps a bit stiff.  No real issue though.
271	0	Went for the dinner buffet this time. More choices to choose from makes this a great place for groups with variety of taste buds. However, I'm still not impressed by their food. The warm crab legs are good (you have to ask the staff to heat them) but nothing to write home about. The Tandoori chicken is constantly coming out the oven so it's extremely fresh. That was the highlight of my meal!!  The prime rib is not the same quality of cut that you experience at Paris or Bellagio. It might be the way it's cooked because it is dry and au jus is a must. Some of the Asian counter foods sit out for too long that it doesn't look as appetizing.  The baked potato stand is not bad as you can customize your stuffed potato to your liking.  Desserts continue to disappoint as they don't have any warm desserts like apple pie. An occasional creme bulee pops up but otherwise it's a counter of slices of room temperature pies and cookies.
272	0	what?!?!? really it is the hilton!!!! so many things went wrong! first we originally booked a king gave us a double... then they switched us out the next day only to have a clogged tub!!! then the room they switched us out.. people were still occupying it!! so the last room they gave us.. sink didn't work, tub was dripping really badly, and the phone didn't work!!! by then we were way exhausted to change rooms!!! the hallways were dirty! the rooms were dusty!!! etc!!! WE HATED IT!
273	0	I was pretty stoked to check this place out, being a big Sammy Hagar fan, but I was pretty damn disappointed when it finally came to trying it out.  Dad and I went down for lunch, and we had a Groupon that was good for $30. We popped in around 12:30 PM, and it was already a difficulty just to find someone to seat us. There was no waitress around to seat us, so the hostess had us wait at the podium for a few minutes, and then she finally sat us herself. At this point, it was no biggie.  We sat down, and a waitress came up and took our drink order pretty quick...very friendly girl. She brought us some chips and salsa, which were pretty good.  I ordered the 4-item combo plate with a Carne Asada soft taco, a Chicken soft taco, a beef enchilada, and a chicken enchilada ($19) . Dad ordered Chicken nachos ($13). Let me just say, this is HIGHLY overpriced food.   The food was brought out, and we marvelled at how little was actually on our plates. Dad's nachos consisted of eight chips with chicken and cheese centered around a scoop of guacamole. To make matters worse, they were extremely bland.  My food was more of the same disappointment. I had asked for my soft tacos with just meat and cheese only, and they were PILED with stuff. When I finally wiped everything off, the meat didn't even taste great at all. It was all extremely bland. The rice was okay, but the enchiladas were HORRIFIC. I've never tasted worse green sauce in my entire life.  Throughout the meal, there was this annoying bus boy who hovered around our table. Whenever we would pause in eating, he would run up to our table and ask if he could take our plate. He did this three or four times, and every time he seemed to get cockier. Let us eat our mediocre food in peace!!  After all was said and done, I'm glad we had a Groupon...though I wished I hadn't even spent the time eating there. Avoid!
274	0	MEH.  I stayed here over labor day weekend (I'm checking out as we speak) and I was not impressed at all. The lobby still looks like it did in the 90s. The gift shop is not remotely up to par with many of the other local hotels. Pretty sure the ugliest shirts ever are sold there and they haven't remodeled since I was 12.  I stayed on the 25th floor. The rooms were updated since the 90s but for some reason they couldn't spend the $20 to cover up the hole between the front door and the carpet.  That being said, I can hear AND feel anytime someone nearby walks by or closes/opens their door. This is absurd for a hotel that is supposedly high end. The doors don't seem to be shut solid so it also shakes anything a door is closed.   So if you need a hotel in Vegas but don't plan on sleeping this is your place to be. Just make sure you don't pay a lot of $ for your room. They don't charge for wifi which is nice at least.
275	0	Being in Miami there are a lot of hot dog places which load up your hotdog with tons of yummy goodness stuff (try the green or pineapple sauce).  So I am used to eating a loaded hot dog...if you can, try it with quail egg.  This place? Why go when you have amazing restaurants all around you.  I get that its a cheaper alternative to the $40 plates around you.  But there is a reason why the hot dog costs $8.  If you are going to go cheaper, maybe just hit up the McDonalds thats located on the same strip.  Its not that this place is terrible or anything.  Its just not great.  So why waste your money or your calories?  The staff is nice and the place feels clean so that is a plus.  You can sit outside and people watch.
276	0	I would say the 3 stars is representative of how the restaurant's food is but for some reason our service was terrible.   There's a to-go window right next door for those who don't want to wait 15-20 min. I came by for lunch on a Saturday at around noon, and placed an order of the beef Thai salad at the to-go window since we were hungry and wanted something to eat while we waited.  Once we got inside, for some reason it took forever to flag down a waitress. When we ordered (orange smoothie, ABC burger and pizza with onions and spinach), she came back 5 minutes later asking me to repeat my order, and if I wanted it for here or to go. What the hell is that supposed to mean? If I'm dining inside the restaurant, why would I want it to go??  When the food finally arrived, the order was wrong - they gave us pizza with mushrooms and spinach, and the burger came with a side of french fries which I didn't want - the waitress never asked us for our preference on the side. I asked the server to bring back a side of the coleslaw instead of the fries.   At first I was going to give this restaurant 2 stars but thinking back on the experience, that one waitress definitely ruined it for me.
277	1	Wow!  Wasn't expecting such an amazing meal right as I got into Las Vegas. Always good to eat off the strip.   The meats were perfectly marinated and good cuts. Cooked at the right temperature the meat tastes were tender and flavorful.  Order the salt and sesame oil as a side!  The bulgogi bibimbap was exactly what I was looking for. We ordered the Gangam for two and extra left over. It was the best deal!  The oysters, calamari apps and sides were just that sides.   You come to a Korean BBQ house for the meat and that was phenomenal.
278	1	Love this place!!!  Great curry!  We thought it would be a 45 minute wait for dinner and were seated within 15 minutes.  Really good service and fantastic food.  Have been here a number of times and every experience there has been consistent and enjoyable in every aspect.
279	0	First time trying this place. The things I liked are the sides bar (pasta, salad, mashed potatoes). I didn't like that we were charged for fancy "bottled" water that we didn't know about until the bill came and noticed the bottle was already opened and my cousin said it tasted like tap water. So since we paid for it we asked could we take the bottle and we were told "sure for $12" we passed.   Then we were told there was 12 different selections of meat we counted about 8 and really only had about 3 (ham, tri tip, ny steak) ham was the best to be honest. We didn't like rare or medium rare so we waited quite a long time to get ours well done. So after waiting for awhile we just called it quits. I don't think it's worth the price luckily we had a buy one get one free but still seemed too pricey for what you get. Safe to say my first and last visit.
280	0	Went for breakfast and had terrible service and all the bread and egg items were stale (pancakes, waffles, dumplings, scrambled eggs, etc). Laurie was very brief and dismissive at the front counter and all the employees were just talking in a corner. Maybe have a friendly person at the front counter if you want your tip up front? My boyfriend and I left to get a second round and our plates were still there when we came back. Go to a different buffet if you want a good experience.
281	0	Overrated!! Honestly the (actual) hot dog tasted regular, nothing special...the buns were regular, nothing special...they just threw a bunch of sides on top of a REGULAR hot dog!! At $6-7a hot dog, presentation is only a fraction of what i expected. Don't get me wrong, would i eat here again??...probably...could it be better?? YES
282	0	We arrived at 8:30 pm and the restaurant was busy, we were told it would be a 20 minute wait and 10 minutes later we were seated in the bar area. It would have been nice to be given a choice. We decided to order entrees since it was late. The dinner service was poor the entire night. To begin, my family is French and have lived in the US and ordered water without ice from the server. The busser arrived with the water glasses and they were filled with ice, they asked the busser to bring water without ice and he rolled his eyes and said he would let the waiter know. He eventually returned with two glasses and we assumed he would return, with the other two, he never did. He was asked later to bring a glass with no ice. We inquired about the wines and the server could not offer any information except to try a cab.   The server suggested adding the salad bar after we ordered. It was very disappointing, two of the trays were empty and a few other trays were almost empty. I was happy I did not order the  buffet.  We were in the middle of eating our salads and the entrees arrived. It would have been nicer to have enjoyed the salad. When the food arrived the tables were so close that we had to handle our own plates as the server could not get behind our chairs to put down the plates. The filet mignons were dry and when asked for extra sauce the server returned and said it was impossible as the sauces were cooked to order with each filet. The skirt steak was flavorful and juicy. The bouillabaisse  passed the palate test.   Will I return? No. The  level of service was poor for the price that was paid. The second night when we walked by they attempted to entice us with a special, we all walked by, especially after I apologized for recommending Pampas. I also noticed that there seemed to be a lack of servers with meats for those who chose the rodizio.
283	1	Took us over 30 minutes to find, we thought there would be signs. Right as we were giving up and heading out to eat somewhere else we asked and were directed to a dark hallway second story of cosmopolitan. Worth the 30 minutes to find!!! Pizza is constantly being made, staff is really friendly. Let me talk about the cheese!!! You've seen those commercials with the cheese oozing out of the pizza and when you bite it the cheese literally stretches out from your mouth to pizza well this pizza has all that! Best cheese on pizza I've had. Drinks are pretty pricey for just a small cup $4 other than that everything was great and this is going to be a MUST stop next time we go to Las Vegas.
284	0	Our friend convinced us to check out Cravings buffet before the Love show and boy were we sorely wrong about this place. We came at 5pm and the food selection was temperature cold and we are not talking about the raw bar but the cooked heated food sections.  The only thing at the raw bar are crab legs.  The prime rib was not flavorful---lacked a distinct beef taste even with the Au Jus--remember to include the au jus...you'll need it since it is soooo dry and bland. The roast turkey was also bland and uneventful...thankfully they have turkey gravy a few feet away.   The Chinese and Japanese sections were terrible....the singapore rice noodles were overly seasoned with soy sauce which destroyed the curry flavor. the fried rice and steamed rice were colder than ice cream. the fried rice was overly seasoned with soy sauce.  the roast pork and duck were lifeless and bland...i've had better in Hong Kong....so don't expect much in this section.  the italian and latin foods were also bland, salty and cold.   TIP: if you want hot food, eat whatever you pick right then and there since by the time you get to your table, the food will be cooooooooooooold.   the only lifesaver was the service from our waiter...he was great and made the experience better....  the food is TERRRRRRRRRIBLE --- COLD, BLAND, SALTY and VARIETY CHALLENGED....SAVE your $ and avoid even the early bird special and go to the Wynn.
285	1	Holy Burger!! This place rocks!!! Wanted something off the strip so we didn't have to pay 25 for a burger and found this little gem...  Delicious burgers ranging from 10-18 a burger, plus 2-6 for fries... Not bad in my opinion.  Came here twice in a period of 5 days and each time was unbelievable...   Some of the best burgers I've ever had in my life..  Note to owners: please open this restaurant in the La Quinta, CA area!!! We need a burger place like this!!
286	0	I went here so that I could talk crap about the waiter, but he wasn't even mean!  He just basically ignored us.  I wanted to get into verbal disagreements with someone.  -1 for crappy ribs -1 for no plate -1 for long wait -1 for no paper hat -1 for being expensive  Never coming back here ever again unless its free.
287	1	For my 500th review, I am happy to write it for Shake Shack. This location is the first Shake Shack in the west coast and hopefully more to come! I am from Los Angeles and just happened to be in Vegas the day Shake Shack had its grand opening. Of course we stopped by to get our grub on! To my surprise, it wasn't a long wait. We waited maybe only 15 minutes and they gave us samples of their vanilla and chocolate concretes which kept me even more happy and satisfied.   This is by far the largest Shake Shack I have ever been to. Lots of ample seating inside and outside. Heating lamps outside for those chilly winter nights. Decor is super modern and yet comfy. Service was great as usual and food was done super quick. This is a very friendly and efficient staff considering it was grand opening and there are sometimes hiccups. But I saw no hiccups. They were all a machine and happily working.  My fiance and I got the Stack Shack which is my personal favorite. I love the cheesy portabello mushroom with my burger. I also normally get their vanilla shake but this time we changed it up and got their special which was the salted caramel shake. I am so glad we did. This shake was phenomenal and so delicious and creamy! It wasn't too sweet. It was just perfection.  Just as a heads up, Shake Shack is technically not connected to a specific hotel. It is located in between NYNY and Monte Carlo. You can't miss it!  Ahh even as I am writing this, I am craving their shakes. Their shakes are phenomenal. Maybe I need to go back to Vegas again very soon. I am so happy west coast finally has a Shake Shack of its own!
288	0	Went here last night for my cousins birthday dinner. The atmosphere was cool, the live music was good and the slide they have inside the restaurant was fun for the kiddos. The food however...not so good. It's pretty pricy and on the chicken dish my sister got there was nothing but fat, and I tried one of my grandmother's BBQ ribs and there was barely any meat at all on those either. Definitely not worth the $20 a plate... Probably the only sweet thing about the food was the cotton candy they bring you at the end. Even the biscuits they serve you at the beginning were cold and crumbly. Then at the end the server was even allowed to split up the check! We had to figure it out ourselves. All I can say is I was not impressed...
289	1	Quite possibly the best burger I've had. How many times have you ordered a burger medium rare and it comes out pretty much well done? Not here. My blackjack burger (ciabatta bread/jack cheese) was THICK and cooked perfectly, a little crispy on the outside and very JUICY on the inside. Even the included skinny fries were pretty good. At $14 it was totally worth it. I also had a twinkie milkshake (great idea). It tasted great, but probably not worth it for $9.
290	1	The best breakfast i ever had. U need to wait to get in there. Worth wait.  Any Omelet here is awesome wit Sides Cajun fries or french fries. Fruits on the side.  We ordered 7 different omelets. Each and every person have their own specifications. All our orders are perfect. The waiter's here are pretty cool. If i stayed back in vegas and longer i would eat my Breakfast only here.  They offered us the Banana Muffins after our meal. Thats really awesome. We couldn't eat them so they gave us ToGo.
291	0	I ate here for the first time a few weeks ago.. or supposedly for my first time, and everything was so pretty! It was probably because they had just transitioned from lunch into dinner... Anyway, I was excited. Everything is spaced out very nicely and the food was neatly presented.   The staff were really nice.. especially for having to deal with 4 drunk girls. The lady who was seating us even asked if one of our girls was going to be okay considering she could barely comprehend what was going on.. haha  However, the food is not all that great. I would've rather gone to the Bellagio. I think that the only thing I really liked was the pizza.. but then again, I was pretty drunk. The crab legs were mediocre. Not bad.. just not something I'd want to spend my money on. The prime rib was disgusting - poorly seasoned and dry. I tried a little bit of everything and it all tasted bland... As for the dessert, I didn't even get to that.. Kind of turned off by it so I had fruit instead.
292	0	One of the worst Westins I've stayed in. Rooms were noisy, dirty (bathroom floor), mold and mildew in shower, cigarette burns on carpet (non smoking floor). No flat screen TVs. Small rooms. About the only good thing I can say about this hotel is that the location is decent and they have great beds/linen.
293	0	Had friends from out-of-town as exhibitors for a convention and I so agree with John T -- service is lousy and the food sucks!!!  Granted, it was a food court in the convention center but we were told that the food is catered by Hilton.  OMG!  Skip the room service and pack your lunch/dinner if you have to be there.  Otherwise,... walk down the street to McDonald's -- at least you know what food you're getting!
294	1	Im a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay..When i heard about this place i knew i had to try it..Well i did and I LOVE it..from the burgers to the fries and onion rings. I loved the curry ketchup. The burgers are your high end burgers..so its not cheap but well worth it. If you are a big burger fan you have to try this place whenever you are in vegas.
295	0	This place is overpriced. The steak sandwich had no flavor. The beef was tough and  tasteless. For $23 a sandwich I expected better. Some will say you have to pay at least $30 for a good steak, but I don't care. Good food is good food. If you are known for something, then you should do it well.  The Forbidden Broadway Sundae did not taste good. It was basically a bowl of fat.  The music was too loud too.
296	0	Stay away! Quality is bad, took them 25 minutes to make 4 sandwiches. Ordered them heated, only 2/4 was heated. The other tasted like they just came out of the fridge.  The "Special" is especially bad! The pork roll has barely any pork, full of fillers.
297	1	Adam Richman I have to thank u for telling us about this spot it was the best breakfast I've had in my life. Like u said on Ur show the food is mmm my goodness mmm my goodness. A group of us came here to try this place cause we heard great things about it. It was pack on Saturday and we waited for about 45 Min's and we were starving so we couldn't wait to eat. The drinks are good My OJ was fresh u can taste that they just made it and my cousin had the watermelon kiwi it was sweet but good.   The food took about 25 Min's but they tell u that on the menu because they cook everything fresh so a Lil wait won't hurt. I got the MVF special which is the Andy sage chicken and omg that bad boy was da bomb. I thought the chipotle sauce may ruined it but no it made it better and the griddle mash on the bottom so freaking delicious they kept picking at it. It is a big portion but if u love to eat then get it. My cousin got the Chicken and waffles and since I live in L.A we have Roscoe's and they known for the waffles and chicken. My cousin said wtf is that bacon inside my waffle F***ing hell ya. The plate looks like a freaking sky scrapper when it comes out he said it was the best chicken and waffles he ever had but I still like Roscoe's but the best fried chicken is at HHGG IMO.   My cousin In law got the tractor farm with the banana Cinnamon french toast and holy cow that toast had to be 3 inches thick it was ridiculously but I had a bite and it sent me to the moon it was that good. Overall we paid 63 bucks for 3 people which is cheaper then the buffet and I was the only one to finish my meal. Place is kool portions are big the staff is friendly but the wait sucks but 5 stars all the way.
298	0	The only good thing about the Flavors Buffet at Harrah's is their service. The workers are super nice and very friendly. It's sucha shame that their buffet really sucks.  It's a good size buffet that covers different kinds of foods by regions. IMHO, everything sucked, but there were a couple that were by far 'decent' and they were the tacos, which you can pick and choose to put in what you want, the shumai dumplings, ice creams, and salad.  Yet, nothing else was worth my $25 for Flavors.
299	0	We eat here few years back and the food was better - we went there today with the kids and the food was around OK not more then that. Add to that the fact that all buffets in Vegas has this Holiday Price uplift that adds 30-40% to the standard price and one end up not getting his money worth...
300	1	This place has 4.5 stars from 700+ reviews and it doesn't disappoint! The service is friendly and fast. The restaurant is clean and inviting with fun pop music playing in the background but most importantly the food is SO GOOD!  I highly recommend the Korean Kalbi - for $9 you get a generous portion of high quality, thickly sliced and deliciously seasoned meat. It was so good my girlfriend and I immediately ordered a second plate once we were done. The shishito peppers and mushroom medley were also amazing. Hell, everything we ordered was fresh and delicious and tasted amazing off the grill. Heck even the rice was really good and I'm Picky about rice so that's saying something.  We also ordered a bottle of soju to share (Jinro Chamisul) and it was the perfect drink to go with the meal.  My only complaint is that they do charge you for the sesame oil which is usually free in most korean BBQ places. But for the amazing prize, potions and quality of food who is complaining?  I would fly back to Vegas just to eat here ;) this place definitely was a huge highlight of my Vegas trip.
301	0	I was real stoked to hear that White Castle opened up on the strip. And since we were gonna be in town for the big fight weekend, I was hyping up getting a crave case at some point during the weekend. Good thing it's open 24 hours but its location is a little tricky in that you really have to be in the immediate area and just walk over because it's smack dab in the middle of the strip by Harrah's and across the street from the Mirage... I was bummed to find out that this particular White Castle location does not offer the bacon-cheese slider or the jalapeno one. LAME. The bacon and cheese one is so good. Whenever one of my relatives flies to LA from Queens they bring a crave case of that goodness but none in Vegas?? That alone is worth the deduction of 2 stars.  We got there after spending a few hours at Omnia nightclub and were all starving. Luckily the line wasnt too long. We only waited about 10-15 mins before we ordered. As soon as we sat down, the line was crazy... We ordered a crave case. That's 30 sliders. We got half classic and the other 15 with cheese. We got 4 orders of large fries and sodas. The sodas are refillable so that's good. The crinkle cut fries are decent. Some are crispy. Others were a little soggy. The sliders which I was so looking forward to were a little disappointing. Not because bacon wasnt an option but they just didnt taste as good as I remember. The weird thing was the original ones without the cheese were tastier than the ones WITH cheese. They seemed to have way more of the grilled/steamed onions on the originals than the cheese slider. The difference in taste was significant. And I was pretty disappointed... Dont get me wrong. I still scarfed down about 6 of them bad boys but I had no choice, I was starving. But I was still disappointed because I couldnt figure out how the sliders hand-carried on the plane ride from Queens and reheated in the microwave were better than the ones right off the grill in front of me. Puzzling... I hope it improves because if someone like me whose "lightly" familiar with the White Castle menu is disappointed, what more for someone that's a tried & true Craver. Harold & Kumar would not approve...  Funny story... As we were finishing up. A slightly tipsy and partied-out couple who didnt want to wait in the long line for their food offered us $10 for 2 sliders... SOLD. To the lush couple... Only in Vegas.  Service was ok. Definitely no enthusiasm from the cashier that helped us. Theyre probably over it with the characters they see on the daily... Be better White Castle Las Vegas. You should be better than that.  ps - cousins from Queens brought over a crave case a couple of weeks after this trip and sure enough, they were tastier. taste comparison complete... I was right. Vegas needs to step it up.
302	1	THE HYPE WAS REALLY REALLY HIGH when 15 of my friends came here.  Being CA natives, nothing has ever topped in n out. We got all sorts of burgers, fries, shakes, and beers.   In summary: it definitely lived up to the hype. This is going to be a very very successful chain of they keep it up!! Can't believe I am saying this, but I'd rather go here than In n Out .
303	1	Dear god, we have found heaven.  After (yet another) heavy night of drinking, I dragged my ladies out of bed after 2 hours of sleep so that would could get Easter Brunch at Bouchon. They were not pleased...until they tried the food. Then they knew it was worth it.  The ambiance made you feel like you were abroad. Really. The host was helpful and seated us a bit early for our rez. Our waiter (my only compliant about this place) was actually kinda an ass. We ordered 3 entrees but my friend also wanted an order of the doughnuts and he kept "correcting" her that she wanted 2 orders...when in fact she kept telling him she wanted 1. Really odd and unnecessary.  Anyway moving on TO THE FOOD. The bouchon bread pudding french toast was out of this world! Tasted like bread pudding meets apple pie. The beignets were the best I've ever had! Warm and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Their omelettes were also tasty and fresh.   Will be returning here shorty for another fabulous brunch!
304	1	This is probably the best Thai food I have ever had.  The menu is extensive, and I do not think you can go wrong with whatever you order.  I will share my favorites though:  * Tom Yum Kai Soup: a little sour, a little spicy, but a lot of flavor * Crispy Duck with Mint and Chili: very crispy duck skin flavored with just the right amount of spice * Drunken Noodles with Soft Shell Crab: I am not sure why this is called drunken noodles, but it did not make me drunk. * Nua Yang Panang (Charbroiled beef with Thai red curry and cognac): This did make me a little drunk...
305	0	Worst nightclub ever. I was trying to leave when in dark stairwell was attacked by a bouncer. I fought to get free from him. Very scary experience. Did police report all night & nobody cared. Had bruises all over arms & chest. Never heard from nightclub or police again.
306	0	Vacationing in Vegas, I got excited that i saw there was a White Castle located on the strip. For those of you who don't know, the west coast remains White Castle-less and i'm glad that it remains that way.  Unless, you've had one too many cocktails or a yard of a margarita in need of say (1-100 burgers) to satisfy your hangover needs. It tastes just like the ones available at your local Vons/Safeway Freezer section. Save your money for other delicious foods in Vegas.  While i'm sure many people dream of pursuing a "Harold and Kumar" type of adventure (especially because its in Vegas. So why not?) Save your money for gambling or find a better adventure.
307	1	Maybe I'm a sucker for French bistros, but I loved Bouchon. The cocktails are delicious, the wine list varied and the French fare perfectly French and delectable, all at reasonable prices. And though having nothing to do with the food/service, I love their business card letterpress!
308	0	The movie "Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle" was the only reason I wanted to eat White Castle.I waited 11 years to go to White Castle, 11 FREAKING YEARS!!! And I wish I didn't go, totally killed the joy of the movie for me. The sliders are whatever but i guess only good points was the restaurant is still new(ish) and service was great. You want a better burger go find an In'nOut or even Shake Shack which is 10x better.
309	1	Such good burgers.  The other reviewers do not lie.  Don't let the prices on the menu - especially the nickel-and-diming for additional condiments - fool you.  You may pay $20 or more for your burger, but you're getting a burger that's worth more than that.  Your Inner Deliciousness Accountant will balance the books and nod approvingly.  As if being a quality burger joint weren't enough, they have a surprising selection of craft beers available.  I was not expecting to find Dogfish Head IPA on the menu three time zones out of Delaware.  I went with the Fat Tire Ale, though - highly recommended.  I liked it so much, in fact, I drank six more the next evening, BUT THAT'S A STORY FOR ANOTHER TIME.  And in case I haven't made it clear: yes, the $16.00 Kobe Beef burger is worth it.  Protip: tourists, this is a bit of a walk.  Once you get in the front door of Mandalay Bay, you still have to walk through the casino to its attached shopping mall, Mandalay Place, and circle halfway around.  Do not let the Urban Outfitters and LUSH outlets fool you - this is not a mall diner.  This is the velvet rope of burgers.
310	1	This was by far the pinnacle of my dining experiences so far. We ordered the shrimp cocktail, which was very different from the norm but delicious and refreshing with the cucumber cocktail sauce. The shrimp were huge and meaty. We also ordered the American filet and the wellington. My friend likes her steak well done and even at that the filet was cooked so well that you could cut it with a fork. The wellington was delicious. The only thing I would do differently next time is for a light touch on the truffles. We split the mac and cheese as a side and, while it was very different, it was delicious.  The service was stellar. Our waiter Anthony took care of our every need and was so patient and knowledgeable about the menu. This was serious the best dining experience I've ever had. Money well spent and I'm glad I did it.
311	1	If you are looking for an authentic French experience, this is it.  We ate here for breakfast and it was like I was sitting in a cafe in Paris.  All the details (artisan baguette, mustard on the table, serving pitchers) made it feel very French.  Rosemary was our server and she was wonderful!
312	0	I have stayed at this Westin twice.  Was happier the first time, six years ago.  It is only about 3 blocks off the strip, near Bally's.  I think it's an easy walk to the major hotels.  The room and housekeeping service was fine.  They charge over $10/day extra for their happy hour, the water bottles in the bathroom, and parking, whether you use those things or not.  When I extended my stay by a day, the front desk neglected to tell some other department, and a hotel employee woke me up trying to chase me out of my room, six hours after I'd paid the front desk for another night.  I don't think I'll be back.
313	1	So good!! Me and a group of friends ordered the truffle fries (had gravy on top), ramen bowls and burgers.   I ordered the tonkatsu ramen ($10) and the broth was so tastey I didn't even want to add any seasoning. The ramen was really soft and fresh. Loved that the yolk in the egg was still oozing showed the freshness of the egg as well. Two pieces of pork in the soul and it was good but it was all fat.  Also ordered a burger ($15) (forgot the name) but it had onion rings and a sunny side egg in it an it was delicious! The patty is so soft and full of flavor.  The waitress forgot our oxtail fries but that's okay because we were stuffed.   Giant burgers can definitely share between two people with an appetizer. They don't skimp on the ramen bowl either!  Good portion, good price, tastey food!
314	1	My husband and I absolutely love bachi burger! We have made it a tradition for the last three years to make this a mandatory stop on our way back home to SoCal from a Vegas trip. We have only been to this location and every time we have the best experience. The customer service is great and the food is top quality! We always put in at LEAST 2 orders of the pork belly steamed buns (bao). Yesterday, I tried the black garlic Tonkostu ramen. They have a separate ramen menu. Anyways, the ramen was amazing of course. We always leave happy and full whenever we come here. It's always a special treat that we look forward to.   Check out the article my husband wrote on this amazing food establishment: http://www.gravegoodssociety.com/blog/sin-city-pleasure-bachi-burger-shoku-ramen
315	0	It's worth it to go for the fancy desserts. They do have huge portions on those.  But I was so annoyed at the prices for the savory food. It will be like 17 dollars for a hot dog. It just doesn't make any sense.  So go here for dessert. Most people could easily share one thing and still be more than satisfied. But skip it for dinner.
316	0	If I could give this place a zero, then I would. This was the most HORRIBLE dining experience that I've ever had. It is no surprise that they continue to move their business page!  Our cousins invited us to stay with them at their fantastic timeshare and we wanted to show our appreciation by taking them to a nice dinner. Earlier that day, I passed by Pampas and a hostess in front of the restaurant offered me a coupon. It was a buy one get one free offer. I inquired about the price difference between lunch and dinner, and asked that she explain what we should expect to get based on when what time we decide to eat. She told me that the main difference is that there would be 7 meat selections for lunch and 12 meat selections for dinner. We were all excited and looking forward to our dinner. It was a Sunday night, and we were sat right away. This was the only good thing about this night, no wait for a table, but here's the rest of our infuriating debacle. Our server, Karen, approached us a few minutes after we were sat and brought over a couple of large bottles of water. The caps were already removed from the bottle so we assumed that they were trying to be creative in how they served water. We later found out that they CHARGED US FOR WATER! We did not request water to begin with. She should have informed us that there was a charge before placing it on our table. Also, as you'll see on the attached picture that the bottle states that sparkling water is served in the bottle, but it was NOT sparkling at all. I asked Karen why they charged for water that we did not ask for and she said "Nevada has the worst tap water in all of United States, and I would never drink it." Obviously, her reply did not answer my question as to why they charge for something prior to informing us of the charge. BTW, it a minimal charge, but it's the principle.  Karen informed us that our coupon required that we buy a drink, so she goes on to suggest that we buy a pitcher of some type of alcoholic drink. I asked her if the coupon required that the drink be an alcoholic drink, and her response was "Well this is Vegas!" WTH!!! This girl was so irritating. I informed her that my husband did not drink alcohol, and she gave us a look of disgust. What she doesn't know is that it was only my husband who preferred non-alcoholic drinks, and the remaining 3 people would have ordered a bunch of alcoholic drinks, but the look that she gave automatically triggered us to order only the cheapest non-alcoholic drinks (with refills). Time to eat! The salad bar was horrible. It looked as if workers do not check the area to keep it clean. Totally looked unsanitary. Karen claimed there were 40 different types of food at the salad bar, and that was a totally false statement.  The meat options were horrible!!! I was already irritated by Karen's lies and up sales, so it triggered me to keep track of the number of meat options and again ... caught them in a lie! At the most, they only had 6-7 meat options that night for dinner. We asked Karen twice and another worker once if they can bring out lamb and they kept saying it was on its way. It NEVER came out to our table and we noted that it was not ever offered to anyone else. MORE LIES AND DECIT. They were charging us dinner prices for the same lunch options. They could have simply admitted that they did not have the lamb that we requested.  STAY AWAY from this place but if you're brave enough to try it, make sure that your server is not Karen, so that you'll hopefully have a more pleasurable dining experience. Karen's level of unprofessionalism left such a poor impression.
317	0	If this is your idea of a ***good*** (not best, because there isn't such a thing as perfect) banh mi, please expose yourself to more locations.  The good things about this place: +Fast +24 hours open (when you're still partying at 4AM and you want something, hell yes) +Bright and clean  +Clean restrooms +Spacious, hip furniture, and no shortage of seats! Lee's designer sure knew his stuff. Visually appealing. +Efficient Service. I like the automatic vietnamese announcer voice that calls your number when you're called to get your sandwich. And then the guy that calls it in english afterward. Cute idea.  The caveats: -The sandwiches (more on that later) -Can't charge card unless $20 has been met (there's a handy ATM machine here though!) -A bit Expensive for Viet sandwiches  The sandwiches here are like fast food to most Viets. Lol it's not the worst, but not the best. It's acceptable. The #11 Special Combo, #1 Lee's Combo, #5 Grilled Pork and #6 BBQ Pork are all okay sandwiches. They all came out THIN, cold, and the quality of the meat is less-than-tasty, like it's been sitting out. At some traditional places, your pickled daikon, carrot slices, and cilantro are placed in a separate baggie for you to put in yourself to your liking. Here, they already place it in for you. Not a huge deal because some banh mi places do this, but it kind of just reminds me of the fast food feel. Veggies weren't exactly fresh.   The bread is a dry french baguette that isn't made fresh daily, but it's okay. The thinness and the scant flavorings of the ingredients is what bothers me. This place is fast food quality. You could make this at home. Not really worth the price. Maybe it's because I'm used to the traditional places or the ones in Cali that do it right with the quality meats and preparation, but it helps to let people know that this is far from a good banh mi spot.     Their ice coffee is awesome though. A bit hard to mess up and loaded with ice, but still tasty. I remember when I was younger and ordered one at Starbucks thinking it'd taste like viet ice coffee...I was definitely disappointed!   I have to say Lee's really knows how to market! I'm pleased that this empire is doing so well. From the first time I experienced in Cali to now (the first one was actually pretty good ages ago), I'm glad that this company is doing awesome. But then again, it's a franchise. Not that that's a bad thing. It's no mom-and-pop contrary to what most people *might* think. But that's like saying that Subway makes the best sandwich you've ever had, in your life, EVER. (I like Subway once in a while...got nothing against them) Or maybe you're happy with that. More power to ya!   What this place does well is introduce people to banh mi. =] It's just okay, not bad or great, but it's fine for a quick bite. The environment is fun to look at and awesome to hang out at with your friends no doubt. And who can argue with that 24-hour opening especially for late night cravings? Does it warrant a 4-star for the taste and ambiance alone? Nope.  As another reviewer asked, would I go to some hole-in-the-wall over this place for a bit better quality tasting sandwich? Yes. Because it's a huge improvement over the banh mi here in taste and quality; costs just as much if not cheaper; and probably all on the same street (not that much farther than here). It's a simple dish, and I'm NOT expecting gourmet but that doesn't mean you should compromise taste for everything else. I recommend people try other banh mi shops for a better one and to keep an open mind!
318	0	My husband and I stayed at The Mirage this past weekend (3/14-3/16) for our one year wedding anniversary. When we booked, we received two complementary buffet passes. We thought this was great, until we actually sat down to eat...unlimited beer and wine is great if you're a drinker. My husband and I don't drink, meaning that we weren't drunk enough to "think" that the food was good. We each tried a variety of things to give it a chance but nothing really stood out as being fantastic! I will say that their bread pudding is tasty but that's about it. I would have been more disappointed if we would have had to pay for it.
319	1	Great atmosphere, customer service, very good food for the money. Delicious burgers, not the greasy type from the fast food restaurants that give you a heartburn, but a very delicate, tasty, creative ones that leave you feeling full, yet not overloaded. Great beer selection as well.
320	1	We waited 25 minutes for a table and is worth every minute!they make u feel comfortable while your waiting.u can gamble n have a drink while you wait and they announce it over the loud speaker.it was cool!and nice!the french toast was amazing and the bavon melted on your mouth.it was soooo yummy!there portions are huge!i will come back to the peppermill  everytime im here for sure!
321	1	This shake shack is awesome! I tried the one in Washington DC and didn't like it but gave it another chance here in Vegas.  You HAVE TO get the Shack Stack with the beef and mushroom! It is UNFORGETTABLE. So cheesy and warm and satisfying. The is also on the sweet side kind of like those Hawaiian rolls. You can skip the fries, they're average. I ordered the biggest order with the cheese and bacon and regretted my decision.  I love the vanilla shake! So creamy and deliciousssss. The frozen custard was just okay and so was the root beer float.
322	1	Bouchon is a great place to enjoy brunch after the crazy nights of debauchery in Sin City.  I've visited this restaraunt twice and was pleased both times.  The chicken and waffles as simply as I would put it, is the must try.  Bacon in your gravy? No Way!  Chicken was done magnificently with the right crisp and texture.  Definitely would visit again when in Vegas.
323	0	Not a fan of buffets but people I was with wanted to go. Breakfast buffet $18.99 Friday morning, $21.99 on Saturday. I piled a plate but it still isn't worth those prices. I recommend you turn yourself around and go have a freshly made breakfast at the Backstage Deli tucked in a corner of the casino floor at Luxor, near the ticket area for Criss Angel's Believe. Way cheaper, tastier, made to order, and more enjoyable.  The More buffet is 2 sided. Both sides are not quite the same. If you are still going to get the buffet, I highly recommend you head straight to the Omelet station and have the chef make you a fresh omelet because the eggs on the buffet are watery and tasteless. Then you have Brown 'n Serve sausage and bacon. Cheese blintz with blueberry sauce, apple pie filling crepes, biscuits, southern white gravy, home fries, grits, mini pancakes, french toast, corned beef hash. I tried a little of everything the first day. Much of it seems frozen/packaged/heat & serve.  Day 2 I went right to the highlights: Omelet, corned beef hash was REALLY good, add some country gravy on top, lots of bacon, and if you try something sweet go ahead and dump a ladle of the blueberry sauce on it.  Fresh fruit, salads, and mediteranean dips on the center aisle.  On weekends they use 1 side for a few more lunch style hot dishes to make it "brunch" plus chilled shrimp, muscles, crawfish and 2 types of sushi, one was plain cucumber, the other looked like California Roll. Go ahead and skip all that nonsense. Unless your plan is to just take an empty plate up to the chilled shrimp display and go hog wild on it. Then maybe its worth those prices....nah. Still isn't.
324	0	Don't waste your time!!!  I was in a good looking group and skipped the line just to spend the next hour in a line to the over crowded mosh pit( No room to dance at all), then a pushy line to Tao Beach...no dancing....then back in a pushy line back to the over crowded main level, then to a 40 min line to get out!    We almost reserved a table...so glad we didn't!  The crowd often pushed right into the people at the tables.  There is nothing exclusive at all about Tao.  They obviously pay the celebs to come.  I gave it 1 star vs no stars because the staff was kind of nice and the girls in the bathtubs were hot.
325	1	This restaurant blew me away!  Everything was presented well and tasted just as amazing.  Being a Masterchef fan, I had to come to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and experience what he is all about.  I saw the kids on Masterchef Junior cook the famous beef wellington and had to have me some myself.  I immediately booked a reservation for my family on Thanksgiving.  A holiday will gave me a justified reason to be completely gluttonous and gorge to the max.  First off, Steak is located in the Paris hotel.  Just look for the big red sign.  At the hostess desk you will check in, and grab some cool matches :)  You are then seated in the bar to wait for your table.  We were then escorted upstairs to a cool booth with a great view over the entire restaurant.    When you are ordering the waiter will bring over a table with every cut of steak they serve and describe the marbling, texture, and flavor of each piece.   The bread plate is pretty darn good!  The two flavors of the pinwheel rolls (truffle and fig + bacon) are both amazing.  It is like a savory pastry that melts in your mouth.  The other breads were good as well, but the pinwheels are the winners.  The butter is served with black volcanic salt which adds a nice smoky saltiness to the butter.  I got the Beef Wellington which is served rare-medium rare (this cannot be changed due to the way that it is cooked).  The Wellington was so soft and juicy I was in love.  The truffle and prosciutto around the filet mignon was tasty and the pastry around was super buttery and flaky.  So good.  My brother got the short rib which fell completely off the bone.  My parents shared a rib eye because they both have hypertension, elevated cholesterol, and heart issues that they don't want to die of.  The rib eye was sufficient for both of them to share.  The restaurant even cut it into slices to make sharing easier for them.    For the sides we all shared the macaroni and cheese, sauteed mushrooms, and fully loaded baked potato.  The sauteed mushrooms had a nice woodsy feel to it and the mac and cheese was great.  It has blue cheese in it, which surprisingly did not overpower the dish.  For dessert we shared 2 sticky toffee cakes!   I would have devoured it faster if I wasn't so fully of steak.  This is their most popular dessert and I can see why.  They pour the toffee sauce right over the cake when it comes to the table.  The cake itself is light and fluffy and the sauce is just heaven.  The salted caramel ice cream comes in a rectangle form, so it looks like a stick of butter.  It was a little bit salty for me and I would have preferred straight vanilla ice cream instead but it was all good overall.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to spend a lot on a good steak dinner.  The quality of the food matches the price.  It was definitely one of my favorite dining experiences in Vegas so far.   Notes: - Use your Total Rewards card to get a few bucks off everything you order. - Make a reservation. - Enjoy everrrythangg!
326	1	Eating here was the gastronomic highlight of our family Vegas trip, and Bouchon did not disappoint.    The opening bread was warm, soft, and crunchy and the butter was sweet.  For starters, we had the special pork belly and the salmon rillette.  The pork belly melted in your mouth.  The rillette was served in a jar; the waiter scooped out the clarified butter off the top that sealed in the flavor of the salmon.  It was served with some toasted bread and went well with the tableside pot of mustard that is typical of a classic French bistro.  For entrees, we enjoyed the Beef Bourguignon and the Leg of Lamb.  The Bourguignon smelled and tasted great and was fork tender.  The Leg of Lamb was sliced thin and delivered a perfect medium rare and had a delicious au jus.  For dessert, we enjoyed the three Bouchon brownies with ice cream.    Service and atmosphere were excellent.  The room had mirrors and tiled floors to remind you of Paris.  We came with our 2 daughters (ages 7 and 10) and they enjoyed the Macaroni au Gratin (mild cheese and good for the young pallet) and the Croque Madame, which had a fried egg on top of buttery toasted bread that sandwiched in tasty ham and cheese.  Overall, a great experience.  I love bistro food and always seek it out whenever I travel.  This is as close as I'll get to Thomas Keller's French Laundry or Per Se for a few years, and it lived up to my expectations.
327	0	Food was fine the waiter was nice but the duration for food drinks or anything is unreal- stay the hell away and it's way to expensive for what you get... A waste of time and money I will tell all my friends and family to skip this over priced Denny's
328	0	Absolutely disgusting! I'm currently in my room at 1:30am on the Saturday of Labor Day weekend and I can't sleep because of all the noise above my room!! I don't know is there some sort of walkway above, but there's constant rumbling of foot traffic every 15-20 seconds. The reason I'm here for one night is because I'm here for 5 days but my regular hotel was sold out on Sat so I booked a room here because it's a holiday weekend and I couldn't find anything else. Thank God I'll be checking out in the morning and spending the next 4 days in a nice hotel.  This place is absolutely filthy and it stinks!! There is what seems to be blood stains on the wall next to the bed. There are stains on the ceiling?!! The fire alarm has holes in it and quite honestly, it doesn't even have the occasional light blink indicating that is operational LOL the carpet? Don't even get me started. The thermostat on the wall wasn't working and I kid you not, I had to bang on it a few times for it to fire up. Talk about ghetto. Oh, and I forgot the tons of shady people around.   This is probably the dirtiest room I've ever stayed in. The sad thing is, online they list a $14.99 "resort" fee. This is a resort??? The room doesn't even have a refrigerator?! I called the front desk to inquire about that and asked what sort of amenities did they provide to consider themselves a "resort". The answer I got was, "it's not a resort fee, it's a cleaning fee" LOL Since when does a hotel charge a "cleaning" fee? Isn't the room cleaning always a part of it? I travel all over the creation, a lot, and I've never had a "cleaning" fee tacked on to any if my stays anywhere, ever!   Please do not let the positive reviews on here sway you to book a room. I promise you that you will be disgusted and it will be a waste of your money! Believe me. The audacity of this hotel to charge over $100 for a rundown piece of garbage of a room! This is Las Vegas and even the $60 rooms in downtown absolutely blow this "hotel" away. This is LV and Palace Station definitely needs to get with the program! The rooms are so dated and filthy that I wonder how this place is staying afloat in the plethora of hotels that is Las Vegas.
329	1	Delicious food! Loved the Salmon Carpaccio, it was succulent and tasty! We enjoyed a wide range of meat and vegetables from the menu.  The kimchi and other salads provided complimented the meat chosen.  The staff was quick, efficient and very helpful.  I would definitely return for dinner or lunch!
330	0	Serendipity charges double the price for normal American food. Burgers, hot dogs, omelets, sandwiches. Their menu isn't anything special. The portions here are pretty good, but the quality of the food is mediocre and definitely not up to par with their prices. I went with a large party, and we had made reservations ahead of time. We still ended up with a ridiculously long wait. The customer service was terrible.  On a separate occasion, I went with family to get some desserts. We ordered to go from the outside window. We wanted to get the pretzel, but the cashier warned us not to. He literally took the pretzel out, snapped it on his knee, and tossed it out... just to show us how stale it was. We bought a doughnut instead, enticed at how big it was. It was disgusting. The frozen hot chocolate? I'd say it's worth a try, but it doesn't live up to the hype.
331	1	Last week, I had the choice of any reasonable place in Las Vegas for my graduation lunch. Having only had the lunch buffet before at Lotus of Siam, I decided to atone for my past errors in judgment.  I had an opportunity to read the articles all over the waiting area in the twenty minutes or so of wait time, so I learned that Lotus of Siam has been open since around 2000. Amazing. I'll bet the plaza in which they're located was also pretty rundown back then, but the quality of their food has probably not lessened and their reputation has only soared. I did my research this time and, along with some appetizer suggestions from my mom, we picked a lot of specialties and Northern Thai menu options.  The food arrived all at once after perhaps fifteen minutes. Patience is a virtue, as we were rewarded with delicious food. For starters, the tod mun plar (#7, $8.95) was a great take on a deceptively simple fish cakes with nice pickled cucumber. The nam kao tod (#14, $7.95), everybody's favorite crispy rice dish, was definitely yummy but a little too sour for my taste. Also very delicious but not suited for my palate was the yum nuah (#36A, $12.95), which is a great beef salad that's just too spicy for me and paralyzed me in fire and sweat for a few minutes. The spicy catfish with basil leaves (#85, $14.95) was a solid if small portion of sauteed fish in a basil sauce  After recovering from the yum nuah, I delved into the Northern specialties. The khao soi (#A, $9.95) was one of my favorite tastes of the meal. To call it an egg noodle curry is not nearly doing it justice, so I'll just say that you'd better order it when you get the chance. The kha nom jean nam ngyow (#G, $9.95) is a non-spicy pork and rice vermicelli dish that reminds me slightly of a certain Vietnamese dish called bun rieu, but I wouldn't have this one again as it seemed a bit boring compared to some other dishes. The last item from this part of the menu was the nam prik ong (#I, $10.95), a non-spicy dish consisting of a red chili paste and various items to dip into it. Pretty nice, possibly worthy of a repeat, but not a palate dazzler either.  I think the best item we had may have been the garlic prawns (on the chef's choice menu, $22.95). They are certainly pricey, and they are actually kinda worth it. Very crunchy, perfectly cooked, and just delicious. And even considering the modest portions of other dishes, definitely a splurge.  Having finally had items from the proper menu, I can now confidently express my opinion that Lotus of Siam deserves all of its praise. I don't know if I'd tell somebody to fly here just for one restaurant, but when you are in Las Vegas, you must make this a destination. Oh, and you'll definitely want to reserve well in advance if you choose dinner hours. Just saying.
332	1	We were at UNLV for the day and wanted to grab something to eat. I haven't had Korean Barbecue in a long time but this was a great re-introduction to Korean cuisine. I had bulgogi and fried dumplings, which were both great. The serving size was perhaps a little small, so just be sure to order enough food. The service was also pretty good as we were well attended through our time here.
333	1	WOW. This place which is located in the middle of a huge strip mall took my breath away. The minute my friend and I walked in to the restaurant after a long day of walking on Las Vegas Blvd, were surprised to see how big this place was inside. It was about 5:30 in the evening and half the tables were already taken. By the time we finished our dinner, an hour later, the restaurant was full.   Inside, there is a room with a huge selection of wines. The two seating areas were nicely done, typical to most Thai restaurants. The menu had good selection of authentic Thai food and French/American wine. The fried rice that I ordered with basil, tofu and vegetables was done right. The flavors were adequate and of good taste. Fried rolls for appetizer were standard fare but not too fried which is good. Just the right amount of crisp. The frozen banana dessert tasted good just like at most Thai restaurants.   Lotus of Siam is a local Yelp favorite and as you can see from the other reviews, its averages a little over 4 stars. Great place with great food and service.
334	0	Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews on this place before I came. If I did, I would have went elsewhere. This place is a TOTAL 2 star. I'll give it props for being brightly lit and decently clean. I ordered the coconut waffle, some frozen yogurt, an iced mocha coffee and little cream puffs that they make there. The coconut waffle was green....WEIRD. It didn't have much flavor at all. My iced coffee was HORRIBLE. I barely took 2 sips. The red velvet frozen yogurt tasted gross. It had a really weird flavor. I can't quite put my finger on it but it didn't taste like the red velvet yogurt I get a golden spoon.  The cream puffs were ok. They definitely needed more cream. One thing that really stood out, and not in a good way, was the loud speak system that announces when your order is ready.  I've made a rule. DONT EAT AT ANYTHING LESS THAN 4 STAR. I, again, broke my own rule. I try to be spontaneous though. I try to "live in the old days" were Yelp doesnt rule my life. And, that fails me everytime. There are so many good places to eat in Chinatown. Unfortunately, this isn't one of them.
335	1	It's my birthday, and the staff here really went above and beyond tonight to take care of us. I am so appreciative. It's rare, even among top restaurants, to feel like the staff truly care about your particular experience. Tonight I felt like I made new friends.   The rib cap was one of the best steaks I've ever had. The toffee pudding dessert is also now burned into my memory. It's amazing.   Special thanks to Tracy for such a great night.
336	1	I had to add a star for getting to meet Gordon Ramsay. He was genuinely a nice guy. Had some drinks and split a burger at the bar, it was a fantastic burger. Tender and flavorful. The bar staff is as friendly as the rest of the staff that we have encountered.
337	1	Had the sage chicken and it was unique and very tasty.   I was in a hurry and by myself so I sat at the bar.  Service was quick and helpful with suggestions.  It was a little pricey but the portions and quality of food makes up for it.  I will definitely visit again.
338	1	Lots of hype around this place, and I can see why.  I came here last night to eat with some friends (ok more than a few...there were like 20 of us), and I was pleasantly surprised. We were all able to be seated, but I don't know how long the rest of the group was waiting to be seated, and I'm not sure if they made prior arrangements or whatever. (I don't know that this is really the best place for large groups though...the restaurant isn't that big). With such a big group, I thought we would be there forever waiting for food and everything. Not so...the staff were very friendly and everything was a lot faster than I thought it would be. I was actually pretty impressed with the speed. The staff were very attentive, and they joked around with us. Also, not once were our water glasses empty, which I really appreciated.  Anyhow, the food (which is why anybody is reading this review anyhow)... Oxtail chili cheese fries...fantastic! If you've never had oxtail, the meat is really tender and juicy, so it definitely adds a new dimension to chili fries. They also put an egg on it. Also, it's huge so consider sharing it.  I ordered the black and green burger and it was delicious! You can definitely taste the quality meat in it. the combination of ingredients was quite superb. I guess it's a fancy burger, and for a burger it is pricey, but I think it's worth it, at least once in a while. Definitely something unique.  I was quite satisfied, and had a great experience. :)
339	1	First time eating Korean BBQ in Vegas and this place was conveniently located right across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel.  I ordered the Spicy Ramen with Egg which was especially flavorful with just the right amount of spicy.  The wife ordered the Bibimbap original which was a little on the bland side but nothing a little salt and hot sauce can't fix.  The kids enjoyed grilling the bulgogi beef and it came out sweet and tasty.  Overall just really good food and the servers were quick.  Would definitely recommend.
340	0	No bueno. They charge a service fee but service is non existent!! They don't serve you so you have to go get your own drink, our server didn't pick up our plates for a long time and they were piling up so we put them on another table then she noticed and picked them up. We kept doing this during the whole meal.   We brought everything to the manager's attention and she told us they were understaffed and they were doing the best they could!   The food is not tasty and it's all very subpar. Disappointing but they're digging their own grave.
341	0	My wife and I were seated by the hostess and literally as we were sitting down an angry lady stormed over and said our spot is a reserved spot. We looked back for the hostess, who was long gone and the angry lady basically said can't sit here so get out of here. We had to chase down a hostess who eventually put us back in the same spot. It was weird, embarrassing and rude.   The food was very small portions and expensive for what it is. With all the good restaurants around, choose another.
342	0	The worst cafe food in Las Vegas. Seriously! $5 for a baked potato that has been sitting all day and barely reheated. The inside was light brown...possibly cooked the day before. The pork fried rice obviously had suggest in it. Steve's blood sugar skyrocketed to almost 300 after eating 1/4 of a bowl. I tasted it and told him to stop eating it immediately. I could taste the sugar. $40 later for rice and a potato.
343	1	Freaking A!  What a place, what a place!  I just can't get over how exotic and flavorful everything is here so far!  A friend from out of town came in and first on our list was Bachi Burger!  Like the last time, the place was pretty empty, not too busy, but the one thing my gf and I spotted was a new burger!  *The Shogun Burger* (not on the website) $23 Features the Wagyu beef, eel, poached pear, and foie gras! Packed with major flavor and super exquisite! I highly recommend getting a taste of this one.  We also ordered the Crusty Crab and Kalbi Burger. Both which were tasty as well.  I loved the authentic crab on the Crusty Crab and the sauce on the Kalbi Burger.  We went with the eggnog creme brulee with gingerbread cookie.  There were comments of the rum flavor being strong, but I hardly tasted it.  The gingerbread man cookie was cool with powdered sugar on it and tasted perfect.  They also featured a treat all the way from Hawai'i called the Tako Toffee.  It's toffee with a thin layer chocolate and almonds.  Another great experience at Bachi deserves another 5 star rating!
344	1	I had their signature dish, French Toast, which was similar to a light bread pudding and it was superb!  (This coming from a person who hates bread pudding).  I also had their special of the day, eggs with spinach and chorizo sausage omelet with a side of bacon.  Excellent dish as well and the bacon was crispy and very addicting.  The omelet dish was so good that we ordered the exact same dish twice!
345	1	WOW, where do I begin?!?! This place is AMAZING!!! This was the BEST hamburger I have ever had! I ordered the fun-ghi burger, added a fried egg to it and some yummy cheeses. We had an appetizer of fried pickles and egg rolls, both delicious. The burger selection is OUT OF THIS WORLD!! Everyone LOVED their hamburgers!!!. Lots of customization options for the PERFECT burger. If you order a burger, you have to get one of their shakes. These shakes are PHENOMENAL. They are served both alcoholic and non-alcoholic, and are the perfect match to a great burger. I had the red velvet cake shake, with an extra shot, its Vegas after-all and I LOVED it! Atmosphere was very fun and cool. Service was EXCELLENT. Will definitely be going back next time I'm in town.
346	1	I'm so happy I got a chance to eat here. The restaurant is tucked away in a strip mall off of the strip and isn't much to look at. When you get inside at first it looks like your typical Thai place. Then you take a moment and realize the walls are covered with celebrity chef pictures who have been to this place. You then notice the very impressive wine collection. The place is also consistantly packed. Now to the food it was literally a party in our mouths. The food was so incredibly flavorful and bright. It was hands down the best Thai food I have ever had and will make a point to come back every time I'm in Vegas.  I highly recommend this place to anyone. The service was also very quick and attentive.
347	1	As a Ramsay fan..... This place was like heaven; however it's quite hard to make reservations. We were lucky that we walked in randomly and got a seat.   Before you order, waitresses bring iPads to show pretty photos of drinks and interesting gifts of Ramsay that you can purchase .  Fur gras (best I ever had )  Beef willington (even though it takes 90 minutes to prepare, it's so worth it. It melted on my teeth)  Stick pudding (another must have)  South side drink was quite good ( ask them about the story behind the spoon in the drink)    Service was amazing. I got shiitake mushroom and potato as sides, they were wayyyyyyyyyyy too salty. When the waitress asked if everything was alright I didn't want to complain. All I said was how it was good but a lil on the salty side .The minute after the manager came over and replaced the salty ones with freshly made new plates that is perfectly seasoned . Super impressive
348	1	I wished this place existed when I attended UNLV. This place carries a lot of value with the amount of different (yet satisfying) portions/packages that even a poor college student can afford.  My friend and I got the most basic Las Vegas package since we're hungry but obviously not capable of eating a feast by ourselves. It was $45/person and the amount of food cannot be more fulfilling. You get the tradition side dishes + a house salad, along with rice, sauces and miso soup to go along with your proteins that includes beef, spicy chicken, garlic shrimp and pork.  You are however required to cook things yourself comparing to places like Honey Pig when a server would occasionally stop by and manage your food. The place wasn't busy at the time we were dining so the servers volunteered to rotate our proteins for us as we were engaged in a deep conversation catching up on life- What a nice touch.   The ambiance of this place is on the smaller size but comfortable at the least. The service was friendly and attentive and most importantly, the food was amazing for the price that you're paying. I wasn't sure if it was Happy Hour when we dined but when we received our tab, it only came out to be $55. A lot less from what I was expected to pay (hey I'm not complaining) but regardless of it being a mistake or not, I'll happily return.
349	0	The desserts and food are good. BUT not for the price. They charge 10 bucks for a hot dog that is dried up and gross. But, it's an all beef hot dog, so, they get A point for that. You can buy a better hot dog at 7-11 trust me, I love hot dogs. They charge an arm and a leg for food and dessert that is okay/good...Not worth it in my opinion. MEH.
350	1	Best shake I have ever had in my life. Enjoyed the cowboy shake as recommended by my server and ordered the Rossini burger medium rare. Skinny fries, zucchini, onion rings with house made ketchup.  Chipotle aoiloe, pesto and spicy ketchup. Everything is amazing here and the service was great! Our waiter had fabulous recommendations. I like how you can order the sauces individually.
351	1	I've heard good things about Shake Shack months before I found out they're in Vegas, hearing comparisons such as "the In n Out of the East Coast". While I agree the burgers and fries are awesome, I hardly think you can compare the two mainly because Shake Shack is much more expensive than In n Out. Two burgers, one fries, and a root beer float cost over $26 - that's not really fast food price, it's more of a sit down burger joint price. I did really like the crinkle fries though - it was so perfectly crispy, perfectly seasoned. My Shack Stack was also delicious, although the whole time I was wishing they'd put more sauce in it.  I'd honestly just commit blasphemy and bring In n Out sauce to put on the burger here. Now THAT would be the best burger ever.
352	1	Who: Bouchon; French restaurant  What: Steak and frites for brunch.  Came out as this 1 inch thick piece of tender steak, topped with minced buttery garlic, and an additional slice of garlic butter and a side of a LOT of fries.  Price: $32-ish.  Friend 1: mussels, Friend 2: trout....both were equally as delicous.  Where: Venetian hotel, top of Venezia tower.  When: Open for dinner daily, open for brunch on Saturday and Sunday  Impression:  We came on a Saturday for brunch ~1pm and there was no wait.  Service was attentive. Food was sooo sooo good.
353	1	This place is swamped but well worth the wait... People can knock on this place but lets be honest they make damn good food and the portions are definitely some of the largest you can eat.    If you show up and the place is banana's (btw banana latte is legit) then try to check in and flirt at the bar and you might get lucky and seat yourself without the wait (your are welcome).  The meat loaf is crazy good, there are a few options of having it, I have owned some and they are tasty.  The Chicken and waffles are amazing!  Love coming back to this place when I can.
354	0	Tried the veggie dog and got an order of cheese fries.  This is probably good for drunk people who just want throw crumpled up money on a table, point at a wall and then ingest whatever they were thrown.  This place is all about the name and nothing else. Everyone in line was using a Groupon and wish I knew that ahead of time. For two veg dogs, two orders of fries with cheese, it was around $20+ from what I recall. You can sub a veg dog into any of their menu items. But we opted to make our own with toppings.  The fries are salty and limp and when you add the taco-bell style face nacho cheese on-top, its just a gastrointestinal mess. The dogs are large in portion but were not hot (temp wise) as I'd expect for something that was 'just made'.  If your desperate for food, this might be an option, but by all means, its not the only option in this area.
355	1	I'm not big on hamburgers only because I think of fast food when I eat them and how unhealthy it is...BUT this place is freaking amazing. They use 100% Angus beef, super fresh, the sweet potato fries with the ketchup-hawaiian dressing is awesome. I highly recommend this place! It's not cheap but for the quality of food that they serve there, definitely worth every penny :)!
356	1	With the various appetizers and meat, it was an amazing experience for me, especially on my first time. We ordered fried calamari, cream cheese wontons, mixed tempura, etc. for our appetizers. The pork belly and bulgogi are to die for. The servers were super friendly and were there when we needed their service. There a specific server that I took a liking who constantly checked on us and he made my stay more pleasing! Hope to stop by when I'm in the area again!
357	1	We usually watch Anthony Bourdain shows for food ideas when we are traveling to exotic international destinations. We don't consider Vegas in that set but we were glad we saw the recent Season 3 show just before a quick weekend trip there.  When our hotel, the Las Vegas Renaissance, also recommended Lotus of Siam, we knew we had to make a visit.   We took a taxi about 2 miles from the hotel (which is near the convention center) to reach the strip mall -yes, it looks a little unexciting from the outside on a Monday morning at 11:45 am. We met two other traveling friends there, and focused on the Northern Thai food (near the back of the menu) that is Lotus of Siam's specialty.   Between the 4 of us, we enjoyed Sai Oua (northern Style Sausage), Northern Larb, and two orders of the  Khao Soi, described as a typical Burmese influenced dish is served with egg noodles in a curry base with a touch of coconut cream, with your choice of meat. (We tried both the pork and the chicken versions.)  All were excellent, and very spicy, although you can request spice levels from 1 to 10. See photos here: http://www.travelingwiththejones.com/2014/05/10/anthony-bourdain-knows-good-food-northern-thai-in-las-vegas/  Take the short taxi ride. Order from the Northern Thai specialties. Enjoy! Perhaps Las Vegas is an exotic international destination after all.
358	1	Our server Patrick was exceptional and the food delicious.  I had the chili rellano omelette and it was a flavor explosion!  The Diablo potatoes that come with it are amazing.  Couldn't stop eating them!Yummy! You get a free banana nut muffin for checking in on Yelp.  It was warm and tasty.
359	1	I seriously dream about this pizza.   On my last few trips to Vegas, Secret Pizza has been one of my first stops every time. One slice is never enough (even though they are HUGE.)  As a pizza connoisseur, I vote that this is the best of the best. You will not be disappointed I promise. And if you are, then we can't be friends.
360	0	I've been to the Mandalay Bay Buffet many times, and the quality has definitely gone down over time.  My favorite is always the prime rib when it's cooked just right at medium rare.  The crab legs are good, but they are not normally fresh and the shells are soft which makes them really hard to open to get that one piece of meat.  I remembered their dessert used to be better also, though their bread pudding is still very delicious and about the only dessert I eat there now.
361	1	Great Pizza. Great concept. For a hotel that builds its brand off of opulence and grandiosity. Its good to know that the Cosmopolitan isn't without a sense of humor or irony.  To find the joint,  just go down the out of place white tile hallway with crappy florescent lighting, you'll arrive in a room the size of a shoebox serving some of the best pizza I've had in recent memory.   Great food, great concept. Well done Cosmopolitan. It looks like management has a few risk takers.
362	0	Wow, how the LA counterpart allows this place to keep using the Pink's name is beyond me.  The first time I went when it opened I was like meh.  The second time I went last month I was like wth!!!  I don't see this place lasting with it never having people there it seems.  The chili is pretty spot on to being the same as well as the dogs but man everything else is just horrible.  I mean I got a crusted tortilla wrapper that was litterarly cracking and breaking as if it was a cracker.  It's almost like they left the tortilla sitting on the counter all night and decided to use it anyways.  I mean if you are going to bring a prized LA landmark like this to LA then do it right.  I mean In-N-Out and Tommy's do it right.  It's just a downright shame for Pink's.
363	0	My wife and I enjoyed the one in New York so we wanted to try this one. The wait was only 20 minutes so it wasn't bad. We have two young boys so we asked if we can have a booth but the hostess said that she didn't have a server. But right after she sat us, she sat three parties into the booths. WTF!? The server that was serving is also serving the booths.  Our food order came out after the two parties that were behind us. My wife ordered the Chinese chicken salad and we got the kids sliders. The food was blah. I probably will not come back.
364	1	Delicious! I don't eat bread and they were very accommodating. Had chicken burger in lettuce instead of a bun with sweet potato fries and each to dip. So good! They sell pear cider too which is a big win for me :)   I will visit again and recommend highly.
365	0	I have had better food and service at Ryan's. We paid $32 per person and a 18% gratuity because we sat with relatives at the same table so a total of $38 per person.   The meat (prime rib, salmon, sausage) was all over cooked. The pasta was cold. The dessert bar was lack luster. The menu posted outside specifically stated "hot lava cake" (the reason my in-laws wanted to eat there) but it was not actually being served.  The server cleared that table only twice despite the 18% gratuity.
366	1	This place is a truly unique experience!  First of all you have to try the Pineapple Tea. If you go and do not try this beverage you're soul will forever be missing a piece.  Next, the burgers are a pleasant mix of barbecue flavor and tender juicy beef patty. Not only are they super delicious but they are also very decent sized. They do come a la carte so I ordered a side of edamame and can I just tell you how satisfying it was to order and enjoy a great plate of edamame at a burger joint?  So much yes.
367	0	I had to see what the hype is all about, with the line out the door every single night since it opened up a couple of weeks ago.  Going in, I didn't think the Corral would live up to my expectations.  Coming out, I decided it didn't, and I will not be returning.  And to be honest, if I had to choose, I'd much rather take my money over to Hometown now that it will be less crowded OR starve.   We arrived five minutes to 6, and the line was already out the door.  We waited a good 20 minutes before we made it to the cash register.  We were able to take advantage of the 2 for $20 special.  The promotion starts after 4 pm, Monday thru Thursday.  The third person had to pay the regular price, eh, no big deal.  We were seated fairly quickly after we paid.    Food was just okay, maybe slightly better than HTB, but not by much.  That cotton candy machine brings a nice touch to the dessert station, but it is super sticky that I did not bother with it.  Everything else was overly sweet.    Service was just okay as well.  Our server forgot to refill my brother's soda, and she never bothered to ask if I needed refill with my water.  I think the drink station should be made accessible to make things easier for all of us.    I can't say I was too disappointed with this place as I didn't have high expectations to begin with.  So if you go in with that attitude, then you'll be alright.
368	1	Phenomenal.  In a city with so many dives, this one is a great find.  We went early, so we were lucky to get a seat at the bar (just barely!) where bartender/mixologist extraordinaire Allison  Bignell treated us to libations and burgers.  Let's just say that my partner is a finicky drink man, and Allison worked him like putty, awing him with drink after drink.  The "AJ SPECIAL" with Smirnoff Whipped Vodka, Ciroc Coconut Vodka, Pineapple Juice, Coconut Sorbet was amazing.  OK, enough about the drinks - let's talk burgers.  You can't go wrong with any burger.  Of course, get it medium rare or rare.  By the time we left (wobbled out), the line was out the door and around the corner.
369	1	Where else in Vegas can you find a restaurant on the strip that has great service, great food, at a reasonable price?  I haven't found one except the one in grand lux cafe. I simply love this place and its a staple every time I come to Vegas.  My favorite dish is the corkscrew noodles with chicken in cream sauce. Favorite dish of all time, place gets an automatic 5 stars for it.
370	1	Perfection in every way. No, seriously.  We were seated quickly by a friendly hostess and greeted instantly by our waitress who was incredibly kind and checked on us often. I never needed to ask for any refills. SPEAKING OF WHICH, they give you a large container of coffee to help yourself. Amazing for beating that hangover. So is the food. Oh.... The food...  It's great and the menu is HUGE. I enjoyed a veggie omelet while my buddy had French toast stuffed with eggs and cheese. Told you you'd be beating that hangover. The home fries are top notch as well.  I love the table system of alerting the wait staff when you need something. There's a smily face at your table that you simply turn to the frowny side. What a good idea.  Needless to say, I loved it here. I now have a new breakfast spot for my Vegas weekends.
371	1	Frankenstein's monster was made out of bits and pieces of unrelated human beings.  So if Frankenstein's monster was staying at Mandalay Bay, where would he eat?   The Burger Bar, where you can have a hamburger made out of seemingly unrelated ingredients.  Kobe beef, lamb, fois gras, lobster, black truffles and avocado are just scratching the surface of the mismatched concoctions that come alive at the Burger Bar.  This isn't a buffet table loaded with burger toppings, but made to order concoctions of your own design (though they do have some pre-designed burgers to choose from).  The creative genius doesn't end with the burgers though.  A selection of Beer Floats are available as well.  That's right - Beer Float.  Ice cream and Beer.  We're no longer serving Mary Shelley's Frankenstien and now serving Mel Brook's Young Frankenstein.  And that's not all bad.  When my wife pointed out the Beer Floats, she laughed.  Unflinching, I immediately ordered the Beer Float sampler.  5 different micro-brew style beers, with 5 different flavors of ice cream.  I have to admit, most of them tasted better than I thought they would, and my wife who mocked me for ordering them was also slurping them down (I don't ever need 5 scoops of ice cream).  While I cannot say that the Beer Floats are the best beverage I've ever had, I can say that it was offered.  The burger however, was one of the best burgers I've ever had (second only to Detroit's Miller's Bar).  The Burger Bar is a 3-star setting with 4-star prices and superior burger options.  Strap it to a table, expose to lightning, and you have a place that even a monster could love.
372	1	I dream of this place sometimes at night, shamefully I devour each delicious bite of a  wagyu brgur with truffle sauce and frois gras. I know frois gois if evil, horrendous, etc etc, but is is sooo delicious. Crispy outside pink in the middle with a matching ground juicy burger below it. I could literally drink the truffle sauce, it's a-mazing. Even if you just dip your fries in it, just do not come here without ordering it.   I ate the whole thing, on my own and stuffed to the gills I wanted more. I love the atmosphere, the service and I prefer to sit at the bar... hence burger bar, but if you must table it then you must table it.
373	0	I stayed here last month and this hotel is definitely a "you get what you pay for" hotel.  It's very small compared to the gigantors surrounding it. You can stand at one end of the casino and see the other end very clearly.  Their giftshop by the entrance seemed to never be open.  The room I stayed in had one power outlet and it wasn't by the desk.  The bathroom door didn't fit through the door frame for some reason so it wasn't able to shut.  The air conditioner didn't work but I didn't mind.    I gave a star for the room service ladies and gents.  They were always greeting me and offered towels galore.  The second star is for their mini 24/hr convenience store located by the elevators and pool entrance.  Everything you need is in there.    Speaking of the pool, it doesn't look like what it does in some of the yelp photos.  I think they renovated it and now it's just two pools. The waterfall and two "mini" pools are gone.   Overall, if you're on a budget and want to splurge on other things and just need a place to sleep, this is it.
374	1	I love everything about this place. It stands for something, a voice of truth, reason, and simplicity in a city built on ostentatious complexity and because of this, I can say with complete confidence that there is not a better meal in Las Vegas.   So rare it is to find a great meal and an unbelievable price for Las Vegas that I would choose a meal at the Pizzeria over any other place in town. I mean it. Here you will not find a line for gamblers who have been given complementary dining and line passes, you will not need a reservation, and you will not find a dress code.   What you will find inside this hallway is truth. People who seem genuinely happy you came in to grab a slice. You will find real pizza. Unharmed by some celebrity chef being paid too much to make expensive food that is rarely worth the cost.   Your food is served on a cheap paper plate, your beer is served in a red plastic college party cup. Have a seat on one of the three barstools, play some pinball, watch some sports and soak it in because when you exit through that hallway, you will not find another real restaurant on the Strip until you return.
375	1	The ox tail fries were as good as I hoped. The portion is plenty to share, too. My husband ordered the Sho Gun Burger and I ordered a bowl of ramen (which is actually next door at Shoku Ramen). I love that you can order ramen while you're sitting at burger place. I also ordered the bone marrow as an appetizer. It was my first time having it anywhere so I wasn't sure what to expect. It was a little sweet. I don't think I'd care to order it again but it wasn't terrible. We went on a Saturday around 4:30-5:00 and we waited probably 20 minutes for a table. It got busier once we were seated. I do wish their waiting area was a little bigger.
376	0	We tried it for breakfast since we were staying at the hotel and had a two-for-one coupon. If you're in that same situation, there are worse places you could go, but if you're contemplating paying full price, don't.    If you're in Vegas to enjoy gambling and shows, this might be a convenient option to fill up. If delicious food is on your "must" list, keep looking.
377	1	Cents here for breakfast due to a coupon we got for buy 1 get 1. My wife and daughter shared a waffle and egg meal. I had the chile relleno omelet.   We left feeling full and the meals kept us going all day long. We never needed or wanted lunch.  The food was very good. The potatoes were a little salty, but not overly so. The hot sauces they provide added just the right flavor to the omelet.   The waffle looked huge and was crisp despite being topped with strawberries and cream.   Very good value for the money. Well be back next time we're in town.
378	0	Never paying $20 for beef noodle soup ever again... No matter how fancy u make a beef noodle soup... they can add gold flakes and serve it in crystal bowls... Bellagio or not, I am not paying $20 for a mediocre beef noodle soup ever again. They used so much MSG in it, I felt sick and fell asleep at 10pm... lol.  I also tried my friend's fried rice... it tasted so mushy... Sorry Noodles.. but never again lol
379	1	Can Lotus of Siam be summed up? Can it be leveled by a few words? You'd be hard pressed. Try criticizing the best Thai meal of your life, one that you paid less for than almost every Thai dinner you've ever had.   Completely unpretentious, despite an incredible Riesling selection and the most robust and spicy Thai flavors you'll ever come across. Make sure to order Yam Nua, the grilled steak salad with mint and chili.  I am still speechless after my meal, the flavors lingering on my tongue and beckoning me to move to Las Vegas so I can eat here more often. Well, no meal can drive you that far.
380	1	My boyfriend and I ate here while we were in Vegas a few weeks ago, and we have not stopped thinking/talking about the burgers here since!!  We came in here with very high expectations, since we are avid Kitchen Nightmares watchers and figured this restaurant had the highest standards, and I'm pleased to say every expectation was met.  Our burgers were literally the best burgers we have ever had and we have been craving them ever since. We also loved the fries! The come with 2 delicious dipping sauces, and there was one that I LOVED, but I forget what the name of it was. The prices were also very decent for the quality of food we received.  I HIGHLY recommend BurGR if you're looking for an awesome burger!
381	0	Been to two pinks hot dogs now....The supposedly good one and this one and this one sucks. The hot dog just sucks. It's nasty. Make it  bearable by putting every condiment on it and put pastrami and whatever they have. Cause the dog just straight up sucks.  Oh ya the service is not that great either. Small little place. Wouldn't go  if your drunk. Just go eat mcdonalds or pizza. Not this
382	0	So lets get to the chase, Frozen hot chocolate! So good but so expensive. well luckily I was able to watch the Dbag angry bartender Jesse make this this while it took 30 minutes to get an actual hot Chocolate also.  12 oz cup = $10 or  3 heaping cups of hot chocolate mix, 2 scoops of ice, and a cup of milk = make it at home Serendipity your service is slow and not friendly at all, I dont even know why I tipped the bartender when he got angry when I asked where my friends hot chococalte to go was at after the first 15 minutes of waiting and then waited 15 more minutes at the bar.  GO TO MAX BRENNER!! It is inside the forum shops the shakes are better, the service is better, and you won't get a hissy fit from an employee if your customer is just asking where a drink is when you are just standing arround talking.
383	1	Very nice settings and workers there. The food was awesome my wife had  a Beeny that was very delicious the eggs were poached perfectly. I had a skillet that was absolutely fantastic. The coffee was spot on not to strong or weak. Definitely going to go back it not prices high either, which i throughly thought was going to be more expensive. Very happy to spend my morning eating there. GREAT JOB!!!
384	1	Had the Hawaii Maui steak and it was freaking delicious. Cooked and seasoned perfectly. My friend had the burger and salad which was also good. Great place to eat if you don't want to spend too much money on the strip and still have a good late night meal
385	0	This new parking policy suckks... Now you need to be a pearl member or above to have free parking access or else you need to pay $$ well i am a pearl member this member cards are always giving me issues and causing huge back up to exit out of the structure.. Not very happy!!!
386	0	Not much to say other than the food was terrible. My hamburger was the driest hamburger I have ever eaten and it gave me a stomach ache. My friend ordered the Mac n' cheese and she immediately got food poisoning. Needless to say our trip to Vegas to celebrate her birthday didn't go as planned after she got sick from the food. As a result we didn't even try the dessert, which we were excited for. The service was okay but not enough to give this place more than a one star rating.
387	1	I came to this place with pretty high expectations. Let me tell you what... they did not disappoint!! Our server was extremely helpful and explained the menu thoroughly. I'm not going to explain the entire menu but we began with the Jalapeo Onion Pedals and Zucchini Fries. Man were they delicious. They sound like typical bar food, but these were done right. Perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Not too greasy and not a hint of sogginess.   I opted for the "build your own burger" option.  Chose the Angus Beef, sesame seed bun; topped with: smoked gouda, bacon, over easy egg, lettuce, tomato, onion, and of course TUFFLE MAYO. The truffle mayo was absolutely amazing and is a MUST when you check it out. It takes a special kind of mayo for me to dip my fries in there. I've never in my life dipped my fries in mayo... but I wiped that shit clean.   My girl got the same except Ciabatta bread and caramelized onions. Instead of the mayo she got the Chipotle Aioli. Also very good.   Lastly, I got the Vanilla Shake with Heath bar and Cookie Dough. The shake was really good as well. I'm not a big shake person and honesty I can't remember the last time I've had a shake... but this one was definitely memorable.
388	0	What I imagine to be the worst place to watch the UFC on the strip. We arrived late thanks to a plan delay which should have allowed the staff plenty of time to take care of EVERYONE before as we were the last table to arrive for the reserved seating area. We stepped into the elevator and expressed our frustration with the delay and how much we were ready to eat and drink. Still so much time went past before a waitstaff approached our table  that my husband had to go bar. They didn't have my drink available on the 2nd floor despite it being on the menu so the bartender said he would go downstairs....nope, never happened. Again we waited. We finally got my drink from another staff member and order food...not terrible. The icing on the cake....everyone left their tables and we still didn't receive a bill...we waited til it was completely empty of patrons, still nothing. Time to go in my opinion. Of course they had our card on file from our reservation so of course they got their money, too bad we didn't get what we paid for. Don't go there. Don't be disappointed. Lame place.
389	0	At 1:15 am a third party "engineering" company was on site cleaning out the "traps". The sewage smell was /is overwhelming. It appears this happens every two weeks. It's a very harsh way to be woken up. The fumes actually made me (and the staffer who came up) nauseated.
390	0	Horrible.  In the dungeon of the pyramid.  Went for breakfast but the food was bad.  I bit into a sausage and thought it tasted funny.  I wondered if it was turkey but it was super bitter.  Green inside apparently they don't check the food before they reheat it and serve it.   I told the only staff member i saw and the response was "oh". Not sorry not oh my god where did you get it from.  Nothing.  I live in Nevada bTW
391	0	My inclination is to recommend avoiding at all costs. Draft beers - including swills such as Bud Light and what I not-so-affectionately refer to as that "headache in a can" Tecate - are $8(!!!), so unless you actually take advantage of the happy hour wheel offering drink "specials" or those $3 draft/"free margarita with an entree" cards (not to be confused with the hooker trading cards) handed out on the sidewalks along the Strip, don't expect to drink here on the cheap.  I can't, however, speak for the food, which I took a pass on for no other reason that I don't think tacos should cost $12. But maybe that's just me....
392	0	I booked this hotel room hoping for a "4 star experience" in Las Vegas. When we arrived in the room, it smelled like mold and smoke (even though it was categorized as NON smoking), the carpet was dirty, and the hotel receptionist wont move our rooms unless we paid an extra 40 dollars per night to "upgrade" to a newly remodelled room. Being desperate for comfort and cleanliness, I went ahead and paid the extra 80 dollars to upgrade. I am writing this letter to communicate my disappointment to hotwire's online description of the hotel. I felt mislead and deceived from the hotel description.  Moral: not all "deals" from hotwire leads to a happy ending. Blah.
393	1	My brother and I can here to eat a Kobe Burger and it was pretty good for the price which was $16.  It was nice and juicy and yum yum yum it was so good I can still have that tastes. It came with fries as well. =)  Anyways it is a small place and we found this place out from Rachael Ray back when she was on the food network =)
394	0	Beware of Mafia Charge!!!  The food was ok, but overpriced.  The service was awful. At the end we had an extra charge on our bill of $5.86 When we asked the waitress what this was, she laughed and said it was the mafia charge.  According to her all restaurants in the miracle mile shops charge this extra fee.
395	0	My husband and I live in Las Vegas. We thought that it would be a fun experience. We never had the chance to find out, but reading the other reviews I glad we did not. The hostess needs to find another job. It was as if we were a bother to her. She was extremely rude. We were  dumped by the bar and told we could get food from the bar. We received no menus. I have always thought of living here as a privilege. We have access to great food at any restaurant here in Vegas. My recommendation is go anywhere else except Seor Frog. Do yourself a favor. They get zero stars!
396	1	When in Vegas....  There are so many places to get a good burger, but a great burger AND a shake?! Yeah, Holsteins Shakes & Buns at the Cosmopolitan is the spot. Located on the second floor right off the escalators, look for the cutest cows. The decor at Holsteins is really eye-catching and cute. According to one of the servers, they just changed the artwork last week. (Check some out, I took photos.) There's a bar in the front and the restaurant is located towards the back.   Right after you are seated, you are treated to delish popcorn with cajun seasoning. Seriously, nom nom nom....I could've eaten it all and then some. But, I knew I had to save room for my shake and burger. Hubby and I decided to share a shake and a burger since we didn't want to be stuck with leftovers. That was a good choice because for $9, you get a quality size shake and the extras (that don't fit in the cup). We ordered a vanilla shake that just might have been the most delish shake I've ever had. It was topped with a lot of whipped cream and these tiny pearl balls that were so yummy. We decided on the FUN-ghi burger ($17) which is a beef patty topped with forest mushrooms, caramelized onions, gruyere cheese, frisee, and truffle mayo. Every burger comes with fries and they were yummy! The burger was juicy, messy, and flavorful - but not sure it was worth the $17. (I figured it was hotel food so, hence, the jacked up price.)  Overall, service, atmosphere, and the food were awesome. I would give this place 4 and a half stars, but rounded it up for Yelp purposes. (Gotta take into consideration that it's a food place in a fancy hotel and on the Strip, so you know you are gonna have to pay a premium for food.) In any case, if you've already checked out Wicked Spoon and Secret Pizza at the Cosmo, Holsteins is your next best choice. More popcorn, please!
397	0	Okay, so I have heard really great and raging reviews of this place and was really hyped to check it out for the first time! I came here with a friend who's been here a numerous amounts of times.  The decor and ambiance of this place was actually fantastic. It reminded me of the bubblegum candy land and a little bit of sexy hip at the same time.   The wait was about 25minutes, not bad for dinner on a weekday, and we were seated promptly inside with a view of the strip. That night we saw Penn & Teller eating dinner on the outside balcony, poor guys couldn't even enjoy their night being bothered by tourists and fans, let the men eat!! **My little highlight for the night!**  For dinner I ordered the Salmon Caesar Salad with homemade Garlic Parmesan Croutons that cost almost close to $20 (but it was a huge mixing  bowl portion) While the size might have given you your money's worth, the fish was too fishy and half cooked, the lettuce was drowning in a mayonnaise based Caesar dressing so It was soggy. The only good thing was the Garlic bread/over sized croutons. The disappointment of my night.   After my not-so-appetizing dinner, i was sort of looking forward to a dessert called the Frozen Hot Chocolate, but didn't get the chance to because they ran out of ingredients, so they suggested the hot chocolate sundae. What? isn't it chocolate and ice that you need to make this dessert? Ugh So we opted for the Strawberry Fields Sundae, cheesecake, strawberry ice cream, strawberry topping with whipped cream all for $15.00!!! SERIOUSLY? There was two scoops of ice cream on the bottom of a goblet topped with strawberry compote and LOADS of whip cream. Really is that necessary?   In the end, I made a note to myself that I will never come here again, nor will I suggest this place to anybody. Chili's or Apple-bees in my opinion makes better quality foods at a decent-not-so-overrated price!   Never again.
398	0	This weekend was my first time in Vegas- came with a friend here on business, so his company covered the room. He was working at the conference center, hence the hotel choice. He drove in from LA and was much later than my flight, and the hotel was nice enough to be able to transfer the prepaid room into my name so that I could check in.   We were on the 24th floor with resort club privileges- not sure what to compare this to, because the room was pretty generic. We got a letter listing our resort level benefits, including lounge access on our floor to have a light breakfast, snacks, and wine/cheese social in the evenings, which was a nice touch. Also included free fitness center access, which I'd researched upon arriving and balked about the $20/day access fee- which is insane considering what is actually available. It's essentially a room of weight machines, some treadmills, and three outdated ellipticals. I was surprised. Used it for what I needed and left, but nothing there was worth even half of that access fee for the weekend, let alone the day. Room came with printer-- but I am still waiting, an hour and a half later, for someone to bring me the cord to actually USE it. Housekeeping says they're still looking for it and to go to the business center instead. Will do, but not thrilled about it. Also, my partner was a little annoyed not to get the slippers/robe listed among our amenities.   I'm not a casino fan, so I didn't evaluate that, but the giant sports screen at the Superbook was pretty cool. Didn't want to do the buffet, so went to Paradise Cafe instead on my first night alone. Date and I did the sushi bar inside of Bennihana's the following night.  Having access to the monorail was a plus.  All in all, aside from the printer cable situation and fitness center access fees, it was fine. But just fine. Expectations were a little higher.
399	1	With a few hours to spare before heading back to SF, I wanted to hit up as many restaurants as possible.  Prior to coming to Shake Shack, I had just scarfed down tacos and a slice of pizza hence why I only ordered fries and a milkshake but no burger.  Fries - Probably the best fast food fries that ever existed.  Super Duper use to be good and maybe it's the locations that I've visited recently but the fries are not crispy and super greasy.  Shake Shack however, has the perfect texture, taste, seasoning, crisp factor, and I did not feel guilty afterwards, well I never do.   Black & White (Vanilla ice cream with drizzled fudge) milkshake - its hard to make milkshakes with the right consistency.  I was sucking pretty hard, my cheeks were starting to ache.  After letting it sit and melt for a bit, it did the job but I wasn't satisfied.  Overall, LOVE the fries.  Will have to revisit and try the burger.
400	0	Guess what! We checked into our room and found a DIRTY TOWEL inside the shower and a dirty pillow case. Called guest services and room service has NOT showed up. And they refuse to move us to another room. Customer service at its best guys. Avoid at all cost
401	0	The staff was definitely friendly and helpful.  The menu items were indeed intriguing, with catchy names like "Swallow a Cloud", and "When Pigs Fly".  There are a few foods here (like the signature Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich) whose ingredients I couldn't quite decipher (maybe braised pork belly with char siu???) nor find in another restaurant.  And they have a fried quail/rose petal menu item called "Like Water for Chocolate"! (I'm a fan of the movie).  However, the overall taste was disappointing.  The pork filling in our street sandwiches was salty (even when eaten with the bread).  "Swallow A Cloud" (which was really just a wor wonton noodle soup) was also salty, and I thought that my favorite Chinatown restaurant did a better version (cheaper too).  When served with tea, we were advised to give it a few minutes to brew... I wish I ignored it because by the time I poured it out, it was too bitter.  The lunch was very expensive compared to the experience I got.  I don't mind paying $30/person for lunch, but I think I deserve to be guaranteed at least a satisfying dining experience at that price.  PS: Even though I was a fan of "Like Water for Chocolate", I decided not to order the namesake dish after tasting the foods they started serving us.  It was about $15 to the already bloating check and I didn't want to risk another possible disappointment.
402	1	Absolutely delicious! And the portions are big enough for 2 people! My fianc and I visited the Peppermill on our trip to Las Vegas via a recommendation from one of my good friends. It was not on the strip, so I was a little unsure about heading there at first, but it is more than worth it. We were there for breakfast and the omelets were huge! The menu is pretty extensive, mostly basic dinner food, but something for everyone. I am a lover of breakfast to begin with, but I was over the moon about this place. Did I mention their sugar is colored? At first glance, it almost looks like glitter! LOVE! The service was quick and everyone was friendly. The waitresses wear uniforms that go along with the ambiance of the place: Vegas meets townie dinner meets flamingos...very neat little place that I would have never found if it weren't for a friend who visits her family. I will definitely be returning for another breakfast or two on our next trip to Vegas! Go and get an omelet, you won't be disappointed!
403	0	One of the biggest disappointments in Las Vegas. The concept mixes Street Asian food and Street Mexican Food. The concept with "To Go" windows on two different sides for both cuisines is clever and I was thrilled to try this place as I love street tacos and I'm a huge fan of Jos Andrs. If he came to this restaurant to eat he would be ashamed to have his namesake on this venue between the less than average food and pathetic service. We ordered a few of the tacos at the window and it took THIRTY MINUTES for four tacos! The restaurant wasn't even busy. If it took street vendors that long ANYWHERE they would be desolate because no one would wait that long for street food! Totally ruins the whole point of ordering street food from a window- if we wanted to wait that long for food we would have sat our butts down in a booth somewhere. After the build up and anticipation from the long wait we were starving. I figured it's Jos Andrs so it will be worth it once we get the food- perhaps even up there with Kogi. Unfortunately, the food was terrible. The tacos were messy to eat, and somehow with all of the sauce and food packed into the taco, it still managed to be terribly bland and there was absolutely no flavor. Hard pass on this place!
404	0	Half of everything was ok, the other half more on the so so side.   We arrived at 10:45 which was between the lunch and breakfast time.    They had a line forming with no one to explain that they would not be seating anyone until 11:00.   That was a bit of a turn off.    Also, a crepe bar where the woman has never heard of a crepe suzette???   The service was ok.
405	1	Second time coming here and quality and value still as good as the first. We were a group of 5 people. We got the gangnam for two people and added extra meat to it and it was enough for all of us.    Service is awesome and fast. Servers were attentive and friendly. Never felt bad to stop anyone and ask for a favor. Willing to come back!
406	0	Meh...food is ok, service removing plates from table was good.  The choices were not that alluring.  In the Latin area there were nacho chips???  I liked the Asian noodles and beef with peppers, and the tiramisu dessert.  My husband enjoyed the prime rib. Neither of us liked the crab legs, they were split in half and didn't have much flavor.  At least, this was included in our stay here at the Mirage.  I would NEVER pay for this buffet.
407	0	Let me start by saying that I did not have to pay for food at this buffet.  My hotel package included daily access, so this will give you some further perspective into my review.  Food: I found the food to be monotonous and bland.   The exception is the Prime Rib and the fresh crab legs.  Everything else was below average.  I did not pay for the food, and I was STILL disappointed.  With taxes included, dinner for two would run you about $55.  The food is definitely not worth the price.  Service: I found the service to be mediocre as well.  They line you by party size in one of 5 lines.  From far off, it is reminiscent of a cattle-line.  Apart from this, all the other patrons are hungry as hell and rude; due in part to the size of the lines and long wait times.  Cursing, cutting, and bumping seemed to be commonplace here.  I have received better service (and food) at Golden Corral.  In short, this place had no class at all.  You will certainly leave with the B-G's (Bubble Guts).
408	1	I scoped the Yelp reviews of this place before we went for my birthday and was surprised to find so many poor reviews. I completely disagree with them too, by the way.   We made reservations for 9 pm on a Monday and I didn't make the reservations, but my boyfriend said he had no problem getting them a couple days before. I was pleasantly surprised by the modern feel of the place with the club-esque atmosphere.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Our server, Charles, started us with the drink menu which comes on an iPad, but despite what it seems, you can't actually order drinks from the iPad. We ordered a Vesper and the HK Antioxident [sic]. For appetizers, we ordered the foie gras and half dozen oysters. Before our appetizers came out we got bread and drinks. The panchetta bread was delicious and I could have eaten a whole loaf by myself. For our entree we ordered the wellington for two and we were informed it would take 45 minutes which was fine with us although I'm sure some people would have been less than satisfied with such a wait. Our waiter walked us through the cuts of meat that we had to choose from with the meat cart which is a little unorthodox, but if you don't know much about steak or you forget the difference between a porterhouse and a ribeye, it's good to know what you're getting.  It took longer than say, Chili's, but by the time we finished our appetizers plus 5 or 10 minutes, our wellington was out. We also had a side of creamed spinach which was very tasty. Charles had recommended one side to split and said we'd have the perfect amount of food and he was correct. I thought I would have no room for dessert, but I was wrong. Enter the sticky toffee pudding with brown butter ice cream. This is a must have dessert. We split an order and it was the perfect sweet ending to a phenomenal dinner.   Everything beginning to end was the caliber of food I would expect from a place with Ramsay's name on it. The waitstaff was knowledgeable and I would definitely go back here. However, if you're looking for a quick meal, this is not the place to go. It is a great experience though if you love and appreciate good food.
409	0	Get ready to pay. The food is alright, for some big portions. And I enjoyed it all. But, really, this diner type food is overpriced. I guess you're in Vegas, and you have to be expected to loosen up the purse strings. But you can make the same counter argument because you're in Vegas too.   Saving grace = frozen hot chocolate. This is what they're famous. So it better be orgasmic, right? And oh was it. I could've easily passed up on dinner and just had the Oreo Frozen Hot Chocolate for the night. So yum yum! Come here for desert for sure!
410	0	Tried their lunch buffet here which included salad bar and all you can eat meat. Everything here was horrible , salad bar didnt seem fresh and the meat did not have any flavor. Definitely would not recommend this place.  Food- 0 , service -3 stars, atmosphere - 2 stars
411	1	$5.50 for a slice is about expected, Vegas (esp the Cosmo!!) definitely isn't a cheap place to eat, but the crust was nicely made and it definitely hit the spot. $17~ for two slices and two bottles of water, but there was no line when we showed up and the pizza was very good!
412	0	Positives: Smoke free section of the casino Beds are really comfortable Monorail station at hotel  Ok now for the review. So we are in town for a convention and wanted to stay a few days extra to enjoy Vegas. Decided to book a few nights at LVH because there was a deal I couldn't pass up on a travel site. So we check in and I ask about an upgrade to a room with a refrigerator and was told that there was the newly updated rooms for $20 extra a night with all these extra features like in room coffee and the requested refrigerator. Then in looking at the site there is not much difference in the $10 extra and $20 extra a night. In room coffee maker, yeah my morning caffeine. Until I pick up the cup and read the lid.... $3.50 per cup used. I can get a venti coffee at Starbucks cheaper. Even the room service coffee was a better deal at 2 cups for $5.75. $18 a day resort fee and I have to pay $3.50 a cup of coffee and can only connect one device to the wifi connection. While I am not a big fan of resort fees, usually don't complain too much when I have coffee, wifi, newspaper, gym etc.However,  the resort fee here doesn't cover much and only seems to be an additional fee to increase their bottom line. Now even with the fee, It was a better price than the other hotels with a price of $38 a night for a Thursday and Friday night with major conventions in town. That being said I don't think I will be staying here again. I am in Vegas twice a year at least for work and think I will stick with the hotels I know and have stayed at many times in the past.
413	1	I am a local and until last weekend (halloween weekend) I had never been to this place. BOY WAS I MISSING OUT!   Price is so cheap and the pizza is amazing! Each of us ordered a slice and I got the white pizza with some pepperoni on top. Greasy and delicious. Hits the spot and is a little bit hidden so just ask someone where it is and enjoy.   Service was great and will definitely be coming back here again. Five BIG STARS!
414	0	Old, old, old, and too far down the strip.  I stayed here to go on the cheap.  Not next time.  They really ticked me off the last day.  First, they tacked on an energy surcharge when I checked out.  Is this something required by law of all the hotels now?  This did not happen before.  If it is not law, it is crap!  They should have just added it into the price of their crappy rooms!  To top it off, we went the night before to print out our boarding passes.  they guy at the desk said he couldn't help us, even though he was just chatting up his co-worker.  He told me I could either use my credit card for the machine in the lobby or to go to the business center in the morning.  Assuming it was free (remember, my friends, what it means to assume!) we walked allllllllll the way across the hotel to be informed that there was a dollar a minute charge to use the internet and a 50 cent fee for each sheet of paper we printed off, even though we were guests of the hotel.  What if their internet was as slow as their hotel is old?  It would have cost us a lot for a dollar a minute!  What a load of crap!  I realized then how far away I was from the Bellagio...  One star because they are next to the Peppermill, one of the best places for breakfast in Vegas!!!
415	1	Every trip to Vegas, it is a MUST for us to stop here and eat! This place is AMAZING, everything on the menu is worth trying....  Now, the service.... if I could offer Carol Anne 20 stars, I WOULD! She is super sweet, always with a smile. We are a large family....11 of us!!! Some waiters/waitresses don't like or fear a large crowd...but she took us all with the biggest smile ever!!!!  it's service like that, that makes this delicious experience....PERFECT!!!
416	1	Came in around 5:30 yesterday and it wasn't as busy like the last  time I came into this restaurant but it was steady. A very friendly young Asian lady had greeted us and had asked us to give her a few minutes to set up a table. From the way it looked there was only a couple servers and the hostess who had greeted us. Our waiter Kevin was amazing and explained everything on the menu. Our food came out in a perfect time and everything that we tried on the menu was amazing. My group and I had oxtail, miyagi, black&green, and the lamb burger.  This place is a must try. Every time I'm in Vegas, I always enjoy their food! Very friendly staff and amazing food.
417	1	I'm from Chicago and have also had a lot of New York City pizza but this place is by far better than any pizza ice ever had!!! We've eaten there almost everyday!! Great little hole in the wall! Hidden between two restaurants on the 3rd floor! There's no sign, just follow the long hallway with a ton of pics on the walls! Pizza slices are $5.50! Amazing!! Loved the white pizza!!! Best little gem in Vegas!
418	1	Definitely the BEST burger in Las Vegas (and the salmon is fantastic-ask to have the chef blacken it). Superb beer, ale and stouts. Innis & Gunn Whiskey Cask Stout on the list! If you have a larger party, call them 1st (they don't take reservations) and let 'em know you are coming.
419	0	SBC VEGAS SERIES: 6 of many reviews Where to eat where to eat? I remember back in the day that this used to be reputedly the best buffet in Vegas.... hmmmmmm  People wake me up to head downstairs for some grub... a lil too much grub. I finally realized why I gave up buffets in the first place.. i can't stop knowing that there's more and more for the taking. Grant it there is a lot of food... enough food for days of binging. They got asian, mexican, italian, and then some. Looks like one of the the boats off of Dangerous Catch off loaded here.   But honestly, i wasn't that excited by it all. Nothing really grabbed me by the taste buds and kicked me in the face. I am much more about quality than quantity... most of the time that is. The most appetizing item in the whole place walked out as i walked in wearing next to nothing in 2 inch stilletos.  *sigh of resignation o_0
420	1	First time here a little of a wait but who doesn't wait in lines in Vegas? It was worth it. I wish for the double vs. the single since I was really hungry. Their fires were amazing cut fries they were crispy and had no grease at all and the taste was spot on! The service was also exceptional! The salted creamy caramel shake was a hit. Thanks for building a shake shack in LV. A must eat. Great for the entire family.
421	0	Good god this place is disgusting. It smells like old cigarettes and looks like an old cigarette. You know those Dateline specials where they take a black light and expose things like poo and sperm all over the bed? This is totally one of those places. I even had a dream one night that I got pink eye. So why give it two stars? I got to give it some credit for sucking as hard as it does.
422	0	When reminiscing upon my experience at Beijing Noodle No. 9, one of my standard catchphrases comes to mind - UGH.  My friends had chosen it based on convenience, since we were staying in the hotel and were already in need of a nap.  My foodie alarm definitely sounded at this appalling selection.   The service here was very straightforward and certainly not accompanied by a smile.  The food was pretty terrible as well, with most items doused in salt.  The Sweet Red Bean Buns were perfectly moist and stuffed with the dessert-like paste.  This was the sole highlight of the meal.  The Hand-Pulled Noodles were mediocre at best and rather mushy, in actuality.  The Diced Eggplant Sauce that covered the noodles was so salty that no amount of water managed to rehydrate us.  The Seafood and Egg White Fried Rice was unmemorable and similarly salty.  The main feature that this dining establishment has going for it is the futuristic, white decor that makes you feel as if you are in a spaceship.  The beautiful fish tank also enhances the atmosphere.  However, with so many great restaurants in town, Beijing Noodle No. 9 is not worth your time...or even this rhyme!
423	1	(read the following review to the tune of bobby brown's "every little step")  i can't sleep at night, i toss and turn dreamin' about the peppermill but i get a crave so i'm all choked up can't believe i need another fill and as a matter of fact, it blows my mind how delicious your dessert drinks can be because the drinks you do is a dream come true a real life fantasy  no matter where i am in vegas i've found a great place to love and we will be together, drinking grasshoppers forever it's like that, it's like that  every little vegas trip i take i will go there every little vegas trip i make i'll be at the peppermill yeah.....  the peppermill brings tacky-chic to a whole new level. first of all, don't tell me you don't love plastic foliage, red and blue neon lights, AND fire shooting out of the middle of a watery pit. i sure as hell can't get enough of this place and i don't say this because i'm intoxicated. i say this out of pure, on bended knees kind of love. try their "grasshopper," an alcoholic mint milk shake that flows smoothly through your straw, and i swear, YOU will be as smitten as i am. happy drinking folks! you won't regret it!
424	1	This was my first time to this establishment .. I have to say that I really enjoyed myself.  The food was great, the portions are huge though.  The have a full bar, so you can have a mimosa for brunch or even an afternoon cocktail.  I will def. be back !
425	1	You have not tasted an amazing burger until you have tried Gordon Ramsey. Absolutely nobody should compare this restaurant to bachi, because it is beyond amazing.  My friend and I came here on a Wednesday afternoon and only waited for about 5-10 minutes, which was fine because it gave us time to peruse the menu and check out yelp for some tips.  I decided to try the brittania. The mango chutney made me a little hesitant, but I decided to just go for it and I'm glad I did. The mango, arugula, and sharp cheddar worked in a beautiful medley with the beef. It has this amazing sweet and savory was amazing.  My friend go the euro burger. She really loved it. I tried some of it, but it made me realize that I really don't like goat cheese.   The truffle fries were pretty great. It was actually really big. I shared with my friend and we couldn't finish it with our burgers. The sauce it came with was amazing. The truffle aioli was something else. Y'all need to hit it up!  I forsure can't wait to come here again and try the hog burger, if I'm not really tempted by the Brittania again. It was that good.
426	0	Don't bother! We were greeted by some blonde hostess girl who was being EXTRA rude to everyone who had a question....we asked how long the wait was and they said  it was a 30 to 40 mins but we were on our way out of Vegas so we went to the To Go side....... All 4 of us ordered the bacon cheeseburger which was literally the size of a McDonald's hamburger it came with cheese and bacon no condiments not lettuce or tomatoes with fries an extra large soda for $16 each!!! We could have gone to In n out and spent that much on 2 meals I wanted rootbeer as my drink so They had to give me a small because the rootbeer is more expensive?????.  The banana split my friend ordered was not spectacular I could have made a better one at home plus it wouldn't cost nearly as much.
427	0	It was OK but not great.  I had heard so much about serendipity from my wife after she visited the NY location so we had to try this one in Vegas.  At 3pm our waitress was a little disappointed that we only orders desert and no food.     I got a traditional sundae and it arrived very melted. Tasted kinda plain to me.  Not nearly what I expected.
428	1	My wife and I know breafast fare, and we think Bouchon is the best anywhere, bar none.  Yesterday morning was our second visit to Bouchon - the first was a couple years ago.  The setting feels elegant and calm, in stark contrast to manic hustle of the Las Vegas Strip.  My wife ordered the Quiche du Jour, which yesterday was a quiche florentine (spinach and cheese), served with a simple salad of lightly dressed greens.  I had the Croque Madame (toasted ham & cheese on brioche with a fried egg & mornay sauce) which was served with more french fries than I deserved.  Seriously, Chef, you can pull back on the volume of fries.  But everything, from the complimentary bread served with butter and incredible jam, to the perfect quiche to the wonderful croque, was FANTASTIC.  Highly recommend.  Only criticism was they were a bit snooty when my wife and I tried to swing by for lunch the day before - seems strange that they say they are open for lunch but close at 1 pm.  Regardless, we can't wait to come back.
429	0	This is for breakfast only.  I have to agree with Jax P.  Bland and soggy were the key words.  Service was subpar.  I asked for coffee, but nearly had to hunt down the server for cream.  There were a ton of bagels out, but no toaster or cream cheese.  The fruit was not ripe, the smoked salmon could have been much more flavorful, the sweets were completely unappealing and the cooked dishes were greasy.  The two roasted meats were the best things there.    The best part?  My stomach ached for hours after eating a small meal here.
430	0	Not impressed by this buffet at all, but at least I got it for free! They had a large variety of foods, much like the newer buffets around. Sadly, their quality is severely lacking.  The carving station was very inconsistent. My prime rib was dreadful, but my bf had a good piece. I also made the mistake of trying some ham, which was salty and dry. As for the seafood section, the crab was actually okay... not awesome but okay.  The shrimp cocktail was not fresh at all though. They had smoked salmon which can't go wrong at all.   Desserts: the only thing that appealed to me were the coconut macaroon cookies. The ONLY good dessert. That's really sad because I love sweets.
431	1	This place is awesome! And for being on the Vegas strip, very reasonably priced. I'm vegetarian so I had their fried mushroom burger (2 actually cause they were so gosh darn good!) And my family had the shack burgers and chicken dogs (2 each because from what they said they were the best ever!) And We shared a cheese fry. I don't know what was in the cheese but it was so good writing this is making me want some more. On top of good prices and awesome food they had good, fast and friendly service. Even when my daughter spilled her drink they were nice. We will probably go back to Vegas specifically for this place.
432	1	We were fortunate to come back to this place, it's always a MUST when we stay at the Mandalay. They have great Build-your-own burgers and delicious shakes! Great for a date night or even with friends.   My husband wanted to try the pretzel bun, he decided he probably should've just stuck with the regular white sesame. Wasn't feelin the pretzel bun. That's the only setback, otherwise, we shared one shake, got two burgers, and shared one skinny fries! The fries are soooo yummy.
433	1	My boyfriend and I have been here more than a few times here. We usually come here after work at night time. Always had a good experience and have nothing to complain. The food is always good. We love their Honey Bread the most for the dessert. The bbq grill options has good amount to share as well and very flavorful. The servers are nice as well. We definitely recommend this place.
434	0	There was a little bit of line.  Came here for frozen hot chocolate for $14.00, for small glass. Too sweet and overprice!  Didn't really like the looks of then food from other people's table.  Portion was huge and nothing really stands out.  I guess people who likes quantity than quality love to go there.  I think this place is overrated.  Thanks!
435	1	MAN did I love this place! I really love how creative they are with their presentation. The Fried Chicken Benedict was almost doing too much, but it was worth it! The corned beef hash was great. I have no complaints at all about that. The blueberry pecan flapjack was amazing. We were all talking about the pecans. Then later on that night I snuck away to try one of the scrambles. Another hit!! Everything was amazing!
436	1	Not a lot to add to what's already been stated in previous reviews.  I chose the Hubert Keller buffalo burger and the sweet potato fries.  Best burger I've ever had!  Service was good and we were seated promptly.  I think the prices are reasonable for gourmet burgers.
437	1	OK... Anytime you stay in Vegas and eat at the same place for breakfast 4 days in a row, it's 5 stars for sure.  We would have gone everyday just for the coffee!  Asked about it and heard it was a "four bean proprietary blend".  Damn good!  The food was just amazing as well as the service.  Between our group we managed to try a lot of the menu although my wife got hung up on the quiche of the day which happened to be Florentine each day.  It was creamy deliciousness.  Also sampled were the sourdough waffles, sausage, bacon, corn beef hash, scrambled and over-easy eggs, french toast.  Every bit of it was absolutely perfect.  I would go back daily if I lived in the Palazzo or Venetian!  Bless you Thomas Keller...
438	0	I won't write too much about this buffet. It got the job done as far as filling our tummies but it was nothing amazing. The only thing it had going for it was the mimosas and even those were meh...ok. Just expect your run of the mill cafeteria offerings and you won't be too disappointed.
439	1	We come to Vegas for many reasons, and a visit to Secret Pizza is always on the list.  White pizza...you must try it!  Free refills on soda.  Good service.  Beer on tap.  Galaga game.  2 pinball machines (I always leave 2 quarters on the glass for the next player).
440	1	Went to Gordans steakhouse with the family and friends. Food was really good but quite expensive. Service was great and the restaurant was beautiful. Most Everything is a la carte. It was really cool When they brought out a meat cart and present the different cuts of steak they offer.   We had a big party and had to split a check for our family and they really messed it up. He said it was ok to tip in cash and charge the rest of the bill onto the credit card. We were charged for tip on our credit card after we gave the waiter cash for the tip. We called the restaurant and had to get it fixed. It all could've been avoided if he had remembered to take the gratuity out of the total. I guess we all are human and make mistakes. All in all I Wouldn't mind coming here again.
441	1	Got here on a Saturday (5/16) around noon for a late breakfast. The wait was about 30 minutes but went by fast. The food was great and loved the banana muffin. It comes out very warm and moist... delicious.   What was best was the service. All staff were all very helpful and attentive and seemed truly happy to work there which made it a good experience for us.
442	0	The one downside to our Vegas trip....Hooters Casino/Hotel/shithole.  Okay, I admittedly like Hooters, and given the pricing and the fact that everyone coming from out of town for our best friends wedding was staying here we thought, why not?  oh boy, where do I start....the restaurant. We met everyone here the first night we got in.  I have eaten at Hooters before and have ALWAYS had good service, maybe I'm spoiled. The girls always smile, sit, etc....forget it here. The service sucks big time...she seemed bothered by us, which made us all want to agitate her more.  I must have asked for our drinks three times before i went up and got them myself (she was too busy chatting with another lame waitress and therefore to busy to actually wait on people) LAMMMMMMEEEE Food arrived and it was so-so, nothing like what we have eaten at the Dublin Hooters.   Rooms: shitty, period.  The bathrooms sucked and were so old and outdated, it was comical. didnt smell like smoke, which was the only plus.  I am never staying here again, even if it was offered for free LOL
443	0	... Whattttt- This place is almost as big of a rip off as that Dragon Noodle place, however, this place tasted slightly better.  Mini Wontons = Wonton wrapper. -_________- wtc. All this craziness. I literally had doughy wrapper in soup for lunch. I mean their soup is light and flavorful but it tasted like misc. powder made soup. It was also extremely salty.  The Lai Mien (hand pulled noodles) wasn't bad, but after awhile it tastes redundant. It's a little bit on the chewy side for me too. There was a tiny piece of beef that came with my soup noodle, it was saddening.  I absolutely had nothing for the spicy cold noodles.  Their portions might look tiny but it's actually a pretty hefty serving. So do keep that in mind when you see the price.  But for $20/dish (on average), I would rather have a Subway sandwich, 4 times.
444	0	I'm really surprised by all the positive reviews of this place. I had 3 tacos: barbacoa, carnitas, and a cochinita. We also ordered guacamole for the table.   The tacos are literally street tacos. The ones you can finish in 2 bites. I didn't think any of the tacos had much flavor or kick to it. Being priced at $5.50/taco, this is absurd!  The guacamole you can rave about, but it is $15 for a small order. Really? We needed two for our table.  I don't even consider this place a fusion. It just serves both Mexican or  Chinese food on the menu.  This is my first Jose Andres restaurant and probably my last.
445	0	When the bread basket arrived filled with hot, flakey, tender, and tasty biscuits, we had high hopes for the rest of our meal. Sadly, they ended up the best part.   If you do go, expect a wonderful view of the city lights and a loud, lively environment, but don't come for the food.   Biscuits: awesome - they deserve applause. Snake: too tough to chew. (Yes, we tried it.) Salad: swimming in the dressing and tomato was spongey. Potato Skins: cold and strange flavor. Ribs: they were not falling-off-the-bone. The steak knife could barely separate one rib from the other. They were lukewarm with ho-hum flavor. Corn: mushy Green Beans: fine Surprise Cotton Candy: cute and sweet  We were looking forward to a great experience, but left feeling like the smell of the steer manure at the entrance should have been a premonition: The food stinks, too!
446	0	I placed in the weekly slot tournament and won $50 in credit. When I went to the cashier to have this added to my card,  I mentioned that the credits came at a great time since my sister was arriving later in the week and we could use the credits then.  Her response indicated she had heard what I said.  She said something like  "oh that will be fun"  and I went on merry way.   Flash forward a few days and I go to use the credit.  There is no credit balance on the card.  I go to the cashier cage and a different cashier is working.  I asked her what was up andr she tells me that I have until midnight the same day as tournament to use the credits.  I asked how I was supposed to know this and told her that I had even told the other cashier I planned to use them later in the week.  She apologized and told me to take it up with the casino host.    I was totally unimpressed with the casino host.  She told me that due to gaming commission rules she could do nothing to help me or reissue the  credits I'd won.  I told her that this is very unfair as I had no idea the creditswwould be revoked so quickly.  She said the rules are posted at the tournament.  When I asked specifically where they were posted she didn't know,  but advised that I ask the promo people running the tournament.    So I went back the next week to look for these rules.  Guess what? No rules posted.  I asked.  An employee hosting the tournament told me they could grab me a copy.  But it confirmed what I thought.  I didn't remember seeing anything about rules.   What irks me is that we're talking a $50 prize and it's not even cash! It's credit! Awarding me the $50 credit would be nothing to them. I live next door to the Riv and have spent lots of money there.  So you're going to haggle over $50 credit when the rules aren't posted and the cashier never mentioned a time limit when I gave her the perfect opportunity to do so.    I used to like the Riviera.  The place can go to hell now for all I care.  I would have called the gaming commission on them,  but it's just $50 plus the place will be blown to bits soon enough.  Way to go Riviera.  I'll never return.
447	1	There are 1125 reviews for a reason In this industry (22 years and counting) and especially in this city, it is truly rare when you get amazing service, amazing food in a comfortable, warm, clean atmosphere If I could give 6 stars to our server, Angela, I would. She gave me the best service I have received in this city (2 years) and I have worked and managed some of the best restaurants, bars and clubs Ill be back again and again Thank you Peppermill
448	0	Don't get the food.. It's a rip off! I went to the outside window because I didn't feel like waiting for the restaurant. We got sliders.. they were whatever.. overpriced.  I only wanted to go to try the famous hot chocolate. It was good..Nothing amazing, honestly. I really think Dunkin's is comparable. Had to do it to say I did it!
449	1	This is our first time visiting the restaurant and we absolutely love it! We ordered the Premium package and ordered an extra plate of beef tongue and pork belly to go with it. The menu is easy to read and has pitcures for you to see what each item is (good for first timers). The food presentation was very nice and fresh.   The staff is very welcoming and polite. They were prompt with getting our food out. We loved that they didnt hover over us. They gave us space and let us cook the meat at our own pace (unlike other korean restaurants where they just dump all the meat on the grill and start cooking anything and everything for you whether you're ready for it or not).   The restaurant also has a nice and clean dining atmosphere. We came here around 2pm on Friday and not many people we eating here. We will probably come here every time we visit Vegas (we are from TX).   We recommend anyone who loves korean bbq to come out and try this place when you're in Las Vegas! You will not be disappointed :)
450	0	Walking down Las Vegas Blvd on a sweltering summer afternoon, passing all of these more or less rock bottom priced beer and drink places, we made The Mistake of Massive Proportions and went into Diablo's. Why? It looked good from the outside. And it had those two magic words: Happy and Hour.  We ordered two margaritas, chips and salsa. In Vegas. Where drinks are more or less free. The Diablo "margaritas" were more like watered down 99 Cents Store Lemon Lime sodas and the chips came with three tiny wasabi-sized bowls with non-spicy salty green sauces.   The bill: $32! I asked, "Isn't this Happy Hour?" But my real question should have been, "Happy for who?" Oh, and the $32 included a $4 CHARGE for the chips and salsa!!! WTF!!! When was the last time you paid for chips and salsa? Uh... never!   Moral: Don't judge a book by its cover. Especially when it's called Diablo's. Better you go sell your soul somewhere else.
451	1	Quite possibly the best New York style pizza you'll find on the West Coast. If you've dealt with sub-par NY pizza around town, come to this pizza place and you will not be disappointed.  As you walk through the vintage Italian album collage leading to pizza paradise, you'll find a few gems - including an old San Remo cover - before finding your cheesy reward.  They use cornmeal to crisp the crust and the cheese is stringy and delish.  It feels like a pizza speakeasy amid so many trendy restaurants on that level inside Cosmopolitan, but well worth the mystery hunt to get there.
452	0	Pretty disappointed with the food. The group I went with had a few huge Hooters fans so we definitely had to stop in for some wings. Unfortunately they were a huge let down compared to every other Hooters we have been too.  Cold wings that were more expensive than normal combined with a basically nonexistent waitress made it pretty unexciting
453	1	This is the place for steak, if you like beef Wellington well then eat all you can while you are here because there is nothing juicier than the Wellington here. prices are over 45 on average so prepare your budget. the atmosphere is very nice and waitresses are smoking hot, you can't go wrong here.  Update 3/20/13  Got here again, tried porterhouse 16oz and it was fantastic. Extremely tender, done medium rare as I wanted it, and also got a side of mashed potato puree which complemented the steak perfectly. Our wine enthusiast picked out a bottle of 08 Embruix, Priorat which was fairly nice though a bit spicy for me. Distilled water comes in 9$ bottles, we didn't know that when we arrived so if you don't want to pay for water just ask for ice water (they only ask if you want distilled or sparkling). Hells kitchen tasting menu is also available for a limited time, its 145$ for 5 courses and an autographed photo of Ramsay and 75$ more for wine paring on this.
454	0	Went to MGM buffet for brunch. Thank god we got the buffet vouchers (since we stayed at the hotel) and didn't spend our own money. This is not a Las Vegas standard for buffets, this is more like a HomeTown buffet. Very mediocre food selection, no presentation, rice krispies for dessert?!  Need i say more?
455	0	I've heard good things about this place, besides for the long lines of course, so I thought I would give it a try. My BF was there earlier and waited in line so I was lucky I didn't have to wait that long. We came on a Friday night around 6 and the place was super packed already. It took us about 15 minutes before we were actually seated. Dinner was $11.30 Monday-Friday and $12 over the weekend. Drinks are an additional $2.  As for the food...they have a... Salad bar:  Salad bar was okay. Nothing special about it. You can create your own salad with any topping you could think of or they have a pre-made ceaser salad. They also had 2 different types of soup that day, chicken noodle and chili. They also had your typical potato salad/mac salad/ and stuff like that so nothing really stood out about their salad bar.  Mexican/American/Italian/Asian food: they had a variety of different types of food, but none of them were too my liking. I'm not a picky eater. I'll try everything once, but the food was just...boring to me. They had your typical orange chicken, kung pao something, quesadilla, onion rings, pasta, fried chicken, pizza, fried shrimp, and more.  Grill area: around the grill area they had toast, fried/popcorn shrimp, stuffing and of course the steak. My BF got a steak on his first plate and it was cooked just how he wanted (medium rare) and it wasn't dry at all. He liked it so he got another one and that one came out super dry that he couldn't finish it. But the steak in my opinion wasn't that good. It didn't have any flavor on it at all.  Desserts: they had pies, cakes, the chocolate fountain, cotton candy, and ice cream. None of those things really stood out to me either. I had to get a marshmallow covered in chocolate though, but the strawberries were so tiny and didn't look appetizing at all. Ice cream of course is always good and I've never seen a buffet with rainbow sherbet so that made me happy. And take the cotton candy before you leave!  Service: It was good actually. Better than most buffets I've gone to. Plates were taken away pretty quickly and drinks were refilled when we barely drank half of the cup. Seeing how crowded the place was, I was pretty surprise with the service.
456	0	I have been to brazilian steakhouses before and as their salad bar didnt have too many options. I wasn't disappointed. The men who bring around the meat were polite and did a great job! Me and my boyfriend received a free dinner voucher with them and ended up, upgrading to experience the flipper card dinner. At the end, the waiter brought us our check (we waited longer it felt for the check then it did for us to eat our meal) he explained with the voucher how mich our meal wouldve been and how much it was (free +  our upgrade) and how much we should tip based off howuch the check would have been. Ok great. We had our xash together as we had waited awhile to pay. Instead of letting him walk away, my boyfriend put the cash into the check thing and the waiter opened it up, counted our money and explained we did not tip enough based off his calculations. Excuse me, but we did leave a decent tip and no maybe wasnt based off a 100 check but, we didnt come there expecting to pay or tip on that. We were completely embarrassed as the waiter got loud in counting our money amd telling us it wasnt enough.. the tables next to us could hear and were staring. Forst of all, we were there for 20/30 minutes. Our waiter brought us water and we had a go with the meat one time. I didnt feel good leaving there and in all honesty if we couldve stiffed his ass, we wouldve. That is NOT how you treat a customer no matter how much their bill was. Shame on you guys! If you dont like the vouchers than i suggest you opt out of being apart of it. And his snooty ass can finally make better tips! How dare he!!! My boyfriend ended up tipping beyond even the pro rated calculations against my idea of leaving him even less for the sheer embarrassment he brought to us during dinner on our vacation. So i hope you spent it well!!
457	0	I've stayed at MGM Signature but this was my first time staying at the MGM Grand.  I love the Signature and I would recommend their suites over the MGM but if you do decide to stay at the MGM Grand here's a little warning I wish somebody would have told me. We booked a Jack Pot deal through Southwest. We got a West Wing King. So we arrive at the hotel and check in and begin walking to our room and about 10 minutes later we finally reach the doors entering the west wing. All of a sudden we felt like we were in a college dorm. The carpet was grimy the walls gray concrete The rooms have no view and they're extremely hot. Apparently the air-conditioning doesn't work in the dungeon.  Not ideal for sure but we could have made it work if it didn't take what felt like 30 minutes to get from the lobby to our room!! This place is HUGE so from our room to the pool would have been like half a days journey. We paid some ridiculous upgrade rate to move our room to the Grand Tower just so we wouldn't spend the whole weekend walking back and forth. This is one of those hikes where if your left your phone in the room you'd just say screw it.  2nd issue for me was the staff. There were at least two pit bosses and 4 dealers that literally made me want to leave tables.  I've never had so many people scold me for my hand placement or talking loudly with my friends. Apparently being a little rowdy in Vegas is now illegal? There were some dealers that were a lot of fun but overall I would rate the staff at MGM at a 6 out of 10  There are much better places to stay in Vegas and for sure better places to gamble.  One positive thing I want to make sure to throw in. We rented a cabana on the pool and was very reasonably priced. 800 min food and drink spend. Our waiter Joey was the best. Plus once Calvin Harris came on at Wet Republic they played it over their sound system. We had the best seat in the house. One of my top 5 pool days in Vegas
458	0	This was a disappointment.  Everything looked good, but when I tried it, all the food on my plate was cold (pasta, fish, etc.).  I ended up eating nothing but the crab legs and mussels because they were okay cold.  It was odd because the crab plate was steaming.  Eventually I figured out that if I dug crab legs out from the bottom of the pile and avoided the legs on top they'd be warm, but by then I was pretty full.  Like all the other buffets we tried in Vegas, they expect you to tip before you are even seated.  If you don't want to give a gratuity for service you have not received and you don't carry cash, the only option you have is to stiff the server.
459	0	Thought this might be fun to try on a our trip to Vegas but I would definitely give this a miss. We ordered a lot of the dumplings (not great, and I know dumplings!), plus some noodle dishes, a soup (bland broth) and the Mongolian lettuce salad (the vinegar was overpowering and the sauce gluggy, as if it was out of a bottle).  We then had some tacos and these were much better (especially the carnitas and duck tongue). The Cosmopolitan seems to be full of hen's weekends so the restaurant was full of big bridal shower groups, not our scene.
460	1	Brunch at the Bouchon was WOW. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the Croque Madame (my first bite my eyes opened wide because it was that good). My bf got the chicken and waffles and we both cleaned our plates. Great atmosphere. Sit outside on a nice day and enjoy view of pool and lawn. Come here and treat yourself to a nice breakfast that's not too expensive and delicious! (and yes, I agree with the other reviews that the bread is simply scrumptious)   As for dessert: macarons are located on the lower floor in the Belagio. A must try. I've had macarons at the Napa site as well and they are equally good. Not too sweet as some reviewers mentioned. I personally think they are the best (even compared to SF where I live). As for the Bouchon macarons in Beverly Hills I wasn't impressed with the smaller size or cost. I will let them redeem themselves when the official bakery is opened.
461	0	I'll give this place 2 stars only because the selection of food was great and what I ate was pretty good. However, the way my friends and I were treated by the staff was horrible. I attended a wedding at the Mandalay Bay and the bride and groom chose to have the guest eat here. The guest and weeding party (about 20 people total) went ahead of the bride and groom to go eat. We were told by the cashier at the front that we would have to pay 18% gratuity even though we were all paying seperatly and not sitting together. All we asked of the staff was to sit in the same general area. The staff told us we would have to pay the tax anyway, why I'm not sure; It's not like we asked them to put tables together or anything. Also, there was hardly anyone in the restaurant at the time.   Because this is where the bride and groom wanted to eat and we didn't want to spoil their special day, we decided to pay separately and what does the staff do.... Intentionally seat everyone all over the restaurant. They didn't even try to seat anyone together.   Finally fed up with what they were doing, we took it upon ourselves to find seats next to each other because the staff was being very unreasonable. As I'm walking, I'm being followed and hounded by a waitress and a supervisor asking me and other people "are you going to pay the 18% tax to sit there"? I thought that was very classless and a very poor example of customer service.   The staffer said if we all sit in the same area, we would be overwhelming the waiter; keep in mind this is a buffet where we get our own food, not a waiter. And more so. After we moved and were seated and eating, the wait staff was seating more people in the same area we moved to. If there were originally worried about overwhelming the waiter, why would they seat more people in that section? Especially when the restaurant still was not even half full?  The food is good, the macaroni bar is really good and the seafood was fresh.
462	0	The food is pretty good for a coffee shop. The amenities is lacking, we got our food but we had to wait for the silverware.  We had to ask for condiments and plates which took a while. The server looks like he's walking on sand that's how slow he was. Never again not worth it.
463	0	Our room was outdated at least 20 years. All the carpets throughout the halls were terribly stained. Our tv did not work, nor did our phone. Could not call for room service. Had to call out to some nasty Italian food place. Couldn't even sign in to their promised wifi. No one seemed to care!!! Oh yea, plus a resort fee of $15.00 per day! And tax on top of that!!!???!!!  This place is far from a resort. The pool needs to be dug up and resized to accommodate the amount of people and hotel size ratio! I had really looked forward to this little get away, kick back and get a tan. So much for that, very non-appealing....no space! This place is a dive!!!
464	1	Seriously - how much better can it get than this for breakfast?  I guess if they served it to me at home in my pi's, that would be better, so aside from that actually happening, this is as good as it gets.  Every single thing my hubby and I ate was pure heaven!  We both ordered the specials - mine was a banana, brown sugar & pumpkin pancake.  Every bite was exquisite.  I was soooo happy while eating it!  My husband had something with scrambled eggs, mushrooms, tomato... whatever it was, it was delish and it came with a biscuit that was the best darn biscuit I've ever had.  When it appeared to our very attentive waitress that we weren't going to eat the biscuit, she brought over a peach preserve and butter.  Am I ever glad that she did!  I cannot wait to go back and try more of their menu!
465	1	All you need to know: THE BEST SKINNY FRIES I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. EVER.  Perfectly cut, not greasy, perfectly salted, crunchy outside, soft hot inside. I ate every last one and I could have eaten more.  So it is no secret that I love Hubert Keller.  I have the hugest crush on him with his French accent, charming smile, and gray ponytail.  And I don't typically crush on older men, that's a fact.  I also love how he's always adorably sweet and encouraging on the Top Chef shows.  And his PBS shows make it look easy to make souffle...yeah, right, but he makes it look easy.  So we went to Burger Bar after an unintended visit to the airport to retrieve my BF's lost ID.  Ugh.  This place looks like an updated more upscale diner with booths, tables, and bar seating.  Get your fave type of seating and get ready to stuff yourself!  Burgers are either "build your own" or Chef's burgers that are already designed with toppings, etc.  They even have veggie burgers and fish burgers so if you don't like beef you are still going to find something here.  I ordered the Hubert Keller burger that was buffalo meat with caramelized onions, baby spinach and bleu cheese on a ciabatta with red wine and shallots sauce.  If it is good enough for Hubert it is good enough for me.  The burger was perfectly medium rare and the entire thing was messy and dripping with savory juices from the sauce and the caramelized onions. It was delicious...and huge!  I didn't finish the entire thing but that may have been because I stuffed my face with fries.  The BF got the lamb burger.  This one is with secret spices, tomato, cilantro, and spicy burger bar ketchup.  It had a great spice taste, like Middle Eastern inspired flavor.  And the spicy ketchup - that is the stuff.  We ordered a separate order of that for our fries.  Not that the fries needed ketchup but damn that ketchup was good.  I cannot stress enough how good those fries were.  I am a huge fan of skinny fries, crunchier the better, and dear God they were amazing.    If you don't want burgers, they do have salads and a chicken sandwich too.  They also have milkshakes, including BOOZY milkshakes.  If ONLY I had enough room for one of those too.    Service was good, our waitress was attentive and didn't let us go thirsty.  She also answered that Chef Keller was not there that weekend and told me I could keep up with his whereabouts (i.e. stalk him more effectively) on facebook.  She confirmed that he is a sweet guy just like I already knew.  The prices are pretty standard Vegas if you ask me which means it isn't gonna be the cheapest burger...mine was $22 if that tells you.  And the ketchup extra was $1.  But hey, that's how it goes.  Next time you are in Vegas and want a casual atmosphere and a damn fine burger and the best fries EVER you need to come here.
466	0	Our stay here was okay. We ordered a double queen suite, but somehow got a regular double queen room instead. That really sucked and there was nothing they can do about it.  Our bedsheets had either blood or feces stains on it, I was so disgusted and just ripped off that sheet. I was too tired to complain even more to the front desk people and disappointed already from our room. The shower took some time to get hot water at night time.  Our mini fridge was missing a beverage before we got in our room, but when we checked out we informed them that so they wouldn't charge us.  We stayed on the floor that didn't allow smoking and had better air flow, minerals in our shower or something like that lol, "stay well" floor.  We went to the pool party, wet republic, downstairs one day and my BF stepped on glass out there, there's not supposed to be any glass out there and it's pretty serious for him cuz he's a diabetic. They got him cleaned up, but it kind of hurt his foot all day.  The night club Hakkasan was alright, we went on a Friday night and the crowd there was ehhh. I encountered a lot of rude drunk people that I tried my best not to fight lol. $20 for a glass of lemon vodka. I should have brought my flask since they didn't check the girls' purses. It was pretty crowded, but there's different floors too.   Overall, the hotel was nice. It's in a good location on the strip. I'll probably try a different hotel next time I go.
467	0	After a 5-6 month long sabbatical I have returned to Yelp, and this time I'm back with burning rage for Hooters Casino & Hotel. Boy oh Boy where do I even begin...   As this was the first time to Vegas for my friend and I, I did a tremendous amount of research on the lodging options. After heavy consideration we settled on Hooters, because of the ultra cheap price... I will admit that the reviews I read on the place had me worried, but honestly how much time do you spend in the hotel?   Having that been said let's get down to business...  Before I slam these people let me discuss the positives.   For starters the 1.50$ Bud/Bud light 24/7 was a great deal (honestly that is what sealed the deal on whether or not we stayed there).  The rates really are dirt cheap, you'll be hard pressed to find anywhere that close to that strip any cheaper.    25 cent wings from 12am-6am. Who can say no to that?   Sign up for the Hooters reward card, and you get 200$ in free slot play (promotional only slot area, at 10$ per spin), free steak dinner at Mad Onion (with purchase of 1.50$ beverage per person, and with 1.50$ charge for any add-ons IE. salad, toppings for your potato, onions and mushrooms (which were awful))    I think that about sums it up for the positives at this place....  Negatives.  The Bathroom was kinda nasty.. The tile, and fixtures were old and grimey.   The AC did little to nothing in our room...  No AC in the hallways, stupid hot walking to/from the room.   Excruciatingly long check in/ check out times.  I noticed the painting on the elevator door was peeling off, and they were just like "fuck it... let's not fix it"   The painting in our room was peeled off the canvas... Noticing a reoccurring theme here.   I'm not one to harp on the attractiveness of staff, but the Hooters girls were less than stellar in the department. I go to Hooters for the wings anyways, but for others that may/may not be a big deal.    In all fairness I will say there was a noticeable difference in service between daytime and late hours at this place.   I've noticed something in common with most reviews on this place, people are mentioning the fact that the waitresses/staff are very rude to patrons. Very true! Two stories to share about this one.  1. About 5:40am my friend and I walk into the Mad Onion looking to sign up for the VIP card (so we can get the 25 cent wings) nobody was in line, and the restaurant has less than 10 people inside. The hostess "Crystal" Ignored us for a good 3-4 minutes as she did whatever it was that she was doing behind the counter. Not a single glance... Nothing. When she finally graced us with her presence, she informed us that the person responsible for registering people for the VIP card was on break, and would be back in about 10-15min (25 cent wings end at 6am) and we should just hang around and keep checking back for this person....  Come to find out from a bartender NOT the hostess, the VIP person already left for the night. Sorry no 25 cent wings for you.   2. Mad Onion (again) around 3:30am. Crystal seemed to be in a better mood this time around....  While waiting in line to get a seat (we decided to secure a VIP card for the cheap wings earlier in the day) we notice a large amount of people just walking past the line, and heading into the restaurant. My friend decides to inquire about what is going on at the hostess desk. He asked "What is going on?" (very calm, very collected,) and a gentleman behind the host desk (doing VIP card registration I think) simply responded with "I'm not affiliated with the restaurant."   After about half an hour wait we get sat. (Be aware that with about all the promotional specials offered, you have to buy a 1.50$ drink (alcoholic/non alcoholic) in order to receive the offer.) I order 20 spicy, Bud Light (in order to satisfy the drink req.),  2 blue cheese cups (1.00$ each), and an order of fries my friend follows suit but without the fries.   Food arrives, all but my fries... No problem, server said she would have them right out. Fries never came out?!?!? When it came time for the check, we politely reminded her not to charge me for the fries because we never got them. She scoffed at us and stormed off! REALLY?!?   We compare checks, and notice that my friends bill is higher than mine. He asked for a to go box, and was charged for the box 1.50$ and they charged him again for the wings he didn't finish 2.50$!   At this point we are fuming! How are you going to charge someone twice for food already ordered? It was as if he was leasing the wings w/ the option to buy if he chose to take them off premises... LOL   Needless to say a major scene ensued, and they finally took the charge off.    That is all I care to write about this place...   While I plan on going back to Vegas very soon, I will NEVER stay at this place again!  2 stars for the 1.50$ bud, and the shot at getting 25 cent wings.   peace
468	1	I'm not a name dropper in reviews, however, I have to give credit where credit is due. When you're visiting Las Vegas, Ryan L. is the man who knows where to go. And he definitely wasn't wrong about breakfast at Bouchon.   Nestled in a more remote section of the Venetian, overlooking their smaller pool, it's a little taste of subdued French Bistro dining right in the heart of Las Vegas. Serene and absolutely lovely. We dined outside on the patio and basically had the place to ourselves... which is not surprising at 8 am on a Thursday in Las Vegas. Hell, when we were walking to breakfast, there were oodles of girls in sequined mini dresses still shooting craps in the Venetian casino, but I digress.   My simple scrambled eggs, bacon, brioche toast and croquettes with an iced coffee on the side (it IS 107 degrees in Vegas in July, you know) was done perfectly. The croquettes, my favorite part of the meal, were so incredibly smooth and creamy on the inside, I wanted to swoon. Right at my table. In front of a colleague. Yes, that good.   Pricey? Sure. It's Vegas, baby! Everything is decedent, outlandish and off the charts unreasonably priced. But you gotta eat, right? So why not do it in style at Bouchon?
469	0	We were staying at Mandalay Bay on 9/18 and decided to try the breakfast buffet. I wish I would have checked Yelp first! The service was nice, but the food was horrible! I tried some cold tater tots, stale pancakes with blueberry filling, greasy french toast sticks and fruit. The fruit was the only edible item on the buffet.
470	1	This place the Hamburger is the bomb!!!! The banh mi hamburger is also the bomb!!! There drink signature drink are really refreshing and the bomb!!! (: The place is always packed unless you go there Hellas late like 12midnight.... The service is good the people there are pretty nice and polite. I will miss this place cause im leaving back to kali):....
471	0	For those who wanna try the noodles here, the sauce is good, above the average, but sadly the noodle worth only one star, it claims that it was hand pulled noodles, but it's not, or pulled by a bad chef, too soft, maybe I will consider it when I am 120 years old.
472	0	The website mentions a multi-million dollars renovation... uh? The Riviera is completely outdated, the rooms are divvy, the beds uncomfortable... the overall experience was just lame. The best part, there is no way to sleep with the air-conditioning on, in Las Vegas!!! The A/C units are too old and sound like an engine in the room. We will never go back.
473	0	If I could give this place no stars, I would. The bouncers were rude, the people were rude, everyone treated you like you were literally a bug on the floor and they wanted to smush you with their big, fat egos. Hated this experience and WILL NEVER come back...you couldn't pay me.
474	1	Egg and I is a hearty American breakfast place off the strip. My friends and I had the prime rib benny, cordon Bleu skillet, chicken fried steak skillet, biscuits and gravy , and breakfast burrito. We had coffee with our meal. Reina was our server and she was awesome and attentive. The biscuits arrived  cold and she immediately got us a replacement.  The food itself was great and the coffee was serviceable and generously flowing. Definitely a good day after brunch spot!.
475	1	VEGAS'S BEST KEPT SECRET! You have to go up in the elevator where the guests stay so it is pretty well hidden. This is as good as it gets in terms of brunch. The food was so phenomenal but what really stood out to me was the service and ambience. I felt like I was transported back to another time where waiters wore black ties. The courtyard were we were sitting reminded me of the Sound of Music. Regal!
476	0	This hotel was chosen for it's price tag. But I would NEVER GO BACK AGAIN!!!  I would rather sleep in a rental car.  The hotel is very run down. Maintenance is in over their heads and housekeeping seems to overlook even the most obvious details of cleaning a room.  In order to open the jammed door to our room, you had to lift up and push. The door had broken pieces and dents near the door knob, which makes me believe someone attempted to break into that room at one point. Management apparently doesn't deem this a necessary fix. The bathtub was filthy... Nothing a good scrubbing couldn't fix, but it had a ring around it... As if housekeeping repeatedly bypassed scrubbing the bathtub. It's the first bathroom I refused to use due to uncleanliness. The floor was sticky like it had been mopped with a dirty mop, so I chose to keep my shoes on. My "non-smoking" room was DEFINITELY smoked in and it smelled moist and musky.  The TV didn't work, but maintenance came and brought us a new cable to get it working again. Someone had stolen the cable to the TV. The walls are thin. BUT THE VERY WORST PART: My partner woke up in the middle of the night with a sudden breakout/reaction on both of his eyes.  The DIRTY BEDDING caused this. We left immediately and did not even finish our nights stay. After leaving it cleared up very quickly. He hadn't suffered from a reaction like that since he was a child. But because of past experience, he knew it was an allergic reaction to all the dust and smoke in the room. We were offered another room but not a refund.  I recommend going next door to the Howard Johnson on Tropicana!!!  The rooms are dated but ALWAYS clean and never smell like smoke!!! Not to mention, the price tag is also cheap so you have more money for other things!
477	1	A friend and I went here last night for the first time.  Completely blown away from start to finish!! Even the chairs (we noticed there were different ones available, depending on the table you were sat at. Ours were red leather.) were amazing!! The staff was so professional and knowledgeable about everything on the menu (your table is serviced by multiple staff members) and were "spot on" with there recommendations!!! The complementary breads served were absolutely delicious! We ordered the pork belly appetizer and were so impressed!! Definitely recommend that, if you go!!! For our main course, we ordered both the beef Wellington (how could you skip that??), and the Kobe filet with a butter poached lobster tail. Fingerling potatoes with truffles, and mac'n cheese, rounded off the meal. Ok...when a steak is so tender, your knife has difficulty cutting it because any pressure forces the meat to "surrender"....RIDICULOUS!!! Get the Kobe!!! Beef Wellington...amazing!! Both sides?....amazing!!! Portions, especially the lobster tail, seemed a bit small, but that worked out "famously," giving us "room" for dessert! All I can say is...the toffee pudding thing is OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! I eat out A LOT, and this may have been the best restaurant experience I've ever had!!!
478	1	This is one of the best burger places in town! I have been here about ten times in the past couple months probably, and I am still satisfied and trying everything on the menu!  If you like the whole Asian-style burgers, you will have to try this! Oh, and don't forget to try the Oxtail chili-cheese fries! To die for!!
479	0	Service was terrible, the meat service took awhile before they come to your table. I didn't see the waiter until I had been sitting there at least 10 minutes. Water took another 5 minutes to show up. For a $50 price tab I feel robbed. They wouldn't even accept the $5 off from the yelp app.  I'll never go to this pretend Brazilian steakhouse again.
480	1	My boyfriend and I's ever so often treat is coming here for a Kobe burger. At $16 it isn't cheap, but we share it (it's a good size), and it's soooo good.   We always add provolone cheese, cheddar cheese, cinnamon bacon, and oyster mushrooms. All delicious and to die for.   They carry some awesome beers (try the Wailea wheat!), and service has always been good. The wait sucks, but there's a reason wy this place always has a wait.
481	1	Holy smokes the portions are outta control! Everything we had was delicious. The scramble was perfectly made. The chicken and waffles along with the chicken benedict were delicious. They hit the nail on the head when it comes to the all american meal! The flavors compliment one another like coffee and creamer!   Yummm!! Definitely a must visit.  BTW, unless you're absolutely starving you might consider sharing. But you must try multiple dishes!!
482	1	You can never go wrong with a good slice of pizza. This place can't even be found easily, but it's pretty popular. I guess it's just living up to its name.   When I first walked in, I wasn't blown away by their choices. But, the simpler the better right? Well for this place it definitely is.  I got a piece of the white sauce pizza. I'm usually kind of grossed out by oily pizza, but this one was awesome. I was trying to eat slow to savor the pizza, but it was so good you just want to inhale it. Quite the predicament, huh?
483	0	Oh my, was so insanely disgusting.  I was stupid enough to bring my kids and they had to listen to a lady, if you can call her that, yell and cuss all afternoon.  I asked the employees about what they would do with her and they acted like they had no idea what I was talking about.  The over $25 per day resort fee was just astounding.  Paying for what?  Not to use their pool?  Was just filthy and gross.  Hard beds, nasty bathroom.  Like a pedophiles paradise.  I may be scarred for life, as will my kids.  I feel robbed.
484	0	One of the worst ever had. I'm a local and brought my adult children to see Chris Angel. Have tried several in the same price range and was very disappointed with Luxor's buffet. I think management should eat there and I'm sure it would change. What a let down for a strip buffet. Will spend the extra $$ and go to Bellagio next time.
485	1	People rave about the chicken and waffles for good reason.  Hands down the best I've ever had.  I will return to Bouchon on future trips to Vegas just for this dish.  The lobster hash and hibiscus champagne cocktail were also delicious.  We had several great meals in Vegas but this one stands out as the best.
486	0	We were staying at the MGM Grand and thought a nice dinner at Hooters would be a nice treat for our first night in Vegas. We'd been to Hooters elsewhere before and were looking forward to some yummy wings.  The server was super slow and after she finally took our order and we waited for much longer, instead of coming back with food she said we should order something else because their wings weren't defrosted yet... The menu VERY clearly said NEVER FROZEN so wtf. & other people were eating wings when we left so rabble rabble.
487	1	"Big things poppin' and little things stoppin" - TI  This place is wonderful.  Thank you anthony bourdain and jet tila for introducing this place to the world.  It is off the strip so a bit harder to get to but the food is poppin with flavor.     *****papaya salad - AAammazing spicy but amazing best i ever had **** garlic prawns - poppin with flavor ** soft shell drunken noodle - it was ok  Stick with the dishes at the back of the menu
488	0	Nice decor and quick to bring out food but food and drinks are terrible.   Ordered nachos which was basically a mount of chips with melted yellow cheese slices on the top. For awhile thought they forgot to put chicken but looking more closely there were microscopic pieces atop.   Vodka tonic hardly had any tonic which some might like but I couldn't drink.   after finally getting the waiters attention for check still took another 15 to receive it.
489	0	Everyone knows food in Vegas is ALWAYS over priced, but I always expect a certain type of quality as well... nothing over the top, just a little better than decent I guess you could say..  The food here were below my expectations..   - Pan fried noodles: they were doused in sauce and the noodles weren't even crunchy.. - Chinese broccoli was dry and overcooked..  - Their duck with rice is more of an individual portion rather than a la carte which is what I had hoped for..there was more rice than duck, and the duck portions had mostly bones (although bones are a big part of duck, the bone portion here was more than normal).  The line here is a bit rediculous, and to be honest I'm not quite sure why.. food isnt that great and there are tons of other places open 24/7 in sin city!
490	0	Welcome to the Old Country Buffet of the Aria. For the Aria being a five star resort, it is shocking the buffet is expensive (around $50 a person with tax) for the poor quality. Aria has many great options, sadly the Buffet at Aria is no longer one. The food is mass produced and has little attention to detail. Desserts taste as if they might be the day over left overs from the higher quality options onsite. If you are looking for a much better option- walk across the street to the Cosmo with Wicked Spoon. Aria could learn a lot from their buffet.
491	1	Seriously, some of the best pizza I've ever had... and I had to go all the way to Las Vegas to get it! Sure, I'm here in NYC where supposedly there's lots of good pizza, but so far, nothing comes close to what I had at the Pizzeria at The Cosmopolitan Hotel & Resort. This place is hidden in between a few other restaurants in a shopping & dining area attached to the hotel-- there are no signs, so if you can't locate it, ask around. You won't be sorry.   So what made this pizza so awesome? Well, first off, the crust was just right-- not too crunchy and not too soft... the pizza sauce was perfect and seasoned just right... and the cheese and toppings were fresh and tasty. On two different visits last week, I had a couple of difference slices-- I tried both the pepperoni and meatball. The 2nd time I had them add ricotta to my meatball slice... and all I can say is, "Amazing!"

Tri-colored potatoes were too salty corn bread was super dry chocolate cake was more like a solid block of fudge The "cheese cake" was crap and multi colored Plus the lack of fresh fruit/vegetables.  Were all not ripe.  The only thing I remember that was good was the mashed potatoes.  And yay for cotton candy.  This place def was not the place for a vegetarian either, I pretty much just loaded up on junk food and carbs.  I'd have to say our waiter was really attentive and nice though.

I've eaten at Bouchon in Vegas probably six times now; we stop in whenever the opportunity presents itself, most recently this spring.    While I've had better cuts of meat, the steak here is seasoned in a remarkable way.  I was warned about the gnocchi being different, ordered them anyway, and liked the change of pace.  The stand-by's on the menu will always be there for you so take a listen to the specials because this is a Keller joint and it's truly going to be something of the moment.  I'm not an oyster aficionado so I can't speak with authority on the raw bar.  Go through all the courses -- I had a wee slice of lobster on a few mixed greens here that re-defined salad for me.  The macaroni and cheese is heaven in a cast iron miniature pot.  The pot du creme may be a little better than the chocolate mousse, but I think the flavor changes.  If you have a sweet tooth, do not be afraid or ashamed of having two desserts, preferably one with the house-made ice cream..    Breakfast here may well be the most you'll ever spend for bacon and eggs and it's worth fighting through the hangover and waking up early for it.  The eggs florentine were to die for and do not skip the pastry.  Definitely sit outside while you sip your fresh OJ and coffee as it's probably the only non-recirculated air you'll be able to enjoy in Vegas.  I really like the look of the place; the zinc bar and the tiled floor has a certain charm to it, but it might be a little cliche.  I like the fact that you have to wind your way through the Venetian to find it; it's a hideaway that provides you a two hour respite from Vegas.  The dining room is open, though, and as such is crowded and noisy.  You're not going to have any intimacy here.  I have had both stellar and service that wasn't so much here, but at it's worst I wouldn't say it detracted from my enjoyment too much.    If you stay away from the expense-account-only menu items and the prestige wine list, you should be able to have a positively memorable meal at Bouchon.  You will almost certainly do worse if you're in Las Vegas for any length of time.

Regardless...you wait in a long line(I'm assuming due to it's cheap price) and you can get a drink...I prefer you not to get a drink because you don't even get to refill it yourself and it's like 1.99 which is alright but flagging down your "waiter/waitress"just to get you another drink is kinda missing the point of Buffet? Anyway I'm not entirely sure on the drinks price but I think my friend paid around $11 for his lunch and soft drink so sounds about right.  Regardless I don't find any of the dishes memorable as they all tasted either too bland or too salty. I honestly don't know if i can really complain about it cause you shouldn't expect much but yea. The memorable part for me is that dessert you get to have cookies and cream, pecan, and 2 other flavors of ice cream and it's unlimited so that's something to look forward to even though it's not the best ice cream you'll ever taste but it certainly beats having only vanilla and chocolate ice cream all the time.  Anyway...my tastebud is spoiled so you can give it a try if you want but I don't see myself coming to this buffet any time soon.
495	1	Where else can you get the best tasting pizza in the world at 5am?! Of course, it's Vegas.  Secret Pizza has been there for me too many Vegas trips in a row. And every time, I have to end my night at Marquee with a giant white slice.  But please.. stop raising your prices :(  $4+ for a slice!
496	1	Las Vegas is my hometown and I am there a few times a year to visit family. Bachi Burger was built during my last year in Vegas before I moved to Boston literally two minutes away from my house.  Bachi has the best burgers I have ever tasted in my life. Hands down. I cannot find the words to describe them. I could search the volumes of Poe and Emerson and Twain and even their brilliance combined could not do poetic justice to this burger.  I have since adopted a vegetarian lifestyle and this burger is one of the few meats I miss eating. I still insist on going to Bachi Burger every time I am home for a visit. Their salt and pepper fries (with huge chunks of garlic and jalapeno) and garlic aioli are delicious and I love to snack on them.  If you like burgers, go have a bachi burger. If you don't like burgers, go anyway. It'll make you like burgers.   Oh, and my favorite Bachi memory? I took my boyfriend there for the first time for lunch. He and I were still hanging out at 7 pm and I asked where he wanted to go for dinner. At his request we went back to Bachi Burger.   While waiting to be seated a man walked in and asked us if we'd ever eaten there before. My boyfriend's response was, "Yeah, for lunch." The guy told us he had initially been at a restaurant down the street and asked the hostess there if Bachi was any good. She told him it was ok, but he decided to take our word for it.
497	0	If this was my first time having Vietnamese food, I'd never have it again.  It's not just how obnoxious the exterior is, with the ultra-strong lights that probably drive every insect in a ten mile radius to the store front, or how unnecessarily large the place is - but it's the mediocrity of the food and the stinginess of the restaurant that really just earns it a low, low rating.  Their baguettes are ho-hum, the amount of meat per sandwich is underwhelmed by the pickled veggies, and while the price is great I'd much rather go to Mr. Sandwich and pig out there.  When I say stingy, I refer to their iced coffee.  I love Vietnamese coffee (strong Vietnamese coffee individually dripped with condensed milk and it's delicious and nom nom nom and really should be a dessert), 70% of that cup is ice, the rest is yummy Vietnamese coffee.  Want more?  Ask for low ice and what do they say?  "Sorry, pre-measured, I'll have to charge you twice."  Seriously.  I'm paying three bucks for three slurps of coffee?  I can go around the corner, go either side to Pho Kim Long or a five minute walk and get some Vietnamese coffee for a full serving!    Their spring roll looks like it had two shrimp and some real veggies in there.  It's allll laid on the top with the shrimp sliced in half.  So it's nothing but filler.  Where's the taste?  I was informed that they used to have really great food in California about ten years ago.  I dunno what happened, but wow.  However, I will give it to them - Interior is super squeaky clean, modern, and ultra-bright, as I mentioned, as well as 24 hours.
498	0	This place is way overrated! There was a long line to get in and once our group got in we noticed that the club was not even full. I included some of the many reasons to avoid this god forsaken place.  Reason #1 :  As a female I did not have to pay to get in but my male friends had to pay 30 bucks! Now looking back I wouldn't pay 5 cents to get in!  Reason #2: After about an hour the club started getting full to the point we couldn't move and the stupid bouncers kept telling us to move because we were blocking the way! We couldn't move because there were way too many people everywhere.  Reason #3: The DJ sucked..playing little snips of top 40 hits..lame. Reason #4: Unless you reserve a table do not even plan to sit down and rest or have a drink because there is absolutely no where to sit. Reason #5: Our group got separated and my sister was given a date rape drug here..when she finally found a bouncer to help her he picked her up, carried her to the side of the strip and left her.   She couldn't get up and walk due to the drug she was given.  DO NOT GO HERE..There are  many other nightclubs and lounges in Vegas that are excellent and fun! Don't waste your time.
499	1	Love In n Out? Forget about it, this place will blow your mind! I've never travelled off the strip for a meal. Boy, I was missing out on the best burgers of mah life! I saw stars and angels while I chomped away, while my taste buds screamed out, "Hallejuah! Asian! Burgers! Genius!"  I got to try the miyagi and the kiki burgers and both were divine-okay the miyagi was better because I asked for wagyu beef for my kiki burger and it came out bunless. Not sure if that happens when you substitute the meat or by chance I accidently agreed to no buns?  Bachi Burger, you just made Vegas a whole lot funner for me. Can't wait to come back and try each and every delectable-sounding burger.
500	0	I have several bones to pick with this place.  1) The cashier really talked up the fact that you get free beer and wine with dinner.  Yeah, there are TWO wine choices and just ONE beer. 2) When I did get my beer (which happened to be a Bud Light), the guy at the drink station said that he didn't have limes but that I should ask my server.  I asked my server and the entire buffet did not stock limes.  WHAT KIND OF RESTAURANT DOESN'T HAVE LIMES??? 3) There was a Mexican food station and I got some taquitos (which ended up being crunchy but bland).  I ask the chef behind the neighboring station if they had sour cream or guacamole.  He looked at me as if I had asked him the meaning of life.  He had to call 2 other chefs over to confirm that no, they did not have guacamole (bummer!) and that the sour cream was likely in the salad bar. 4) I asked the lady at the dessert station if she could point me toward some desserts without nuts.  The only ones she pointed to were the sugar free ones.  At the time she was plating some type of chocolate cake and she held one piece of to her face and said "This one probably doesn't have nuts either."  And then she went about her business.  I am so sick of people not finding out for sure or just brushing off the question. I don't ask for fun...I ask because I will literally stop breathing and die if I eat nuts.  They did have some killer garlic mashed potatoes, so it's got that going for it.  Honestly, I love food and I am not that picky, but this place was just not good at all.  Just don't go here.
501	1	Gem's Secret!  For my 20th review, I'm going to share with you a golden gem secret...The best place to eat in The Cosmopolitan won't cost you all of your night's winnings, and you won't be ready to go buffet again right away! But it's whereabouts are incognito, so I will yelp you out & share the secret! After a long night of committing sins in Sin City, you must find & dine at the clandestine "Secret Pizza."  Secret Pizza is a hidden gem located in The Cosmopolitan Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, NV.It's a tiny, gemazing pizza joint located on the 3rd floor of The Cosmo next to the Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill. You will see an unmarked hallway that's lined with cool, vintage record album covers that is across from the pool table located in the middle of the room, go down it & enter secret pizza paradise!  Secret Pizza sells a variety ofbomb, thin/foldable, NY-style pizzas sold by the slice that are pre-made & they warm up for you in the oven. The price for 1 slice is around $5-6, more if you get a specialty slice or add extra toppings. (Secret Pizza also has a "deep-dish looking" pizza slice option, but I didn't try it. This isn't Chicago, stick with the original, thin slices!) You can also order & carry-out a whole pie or customize a cheese slice like I did. My fave was cheese with mushrooms, green peppers & banana peppers, 5 gems!!  When I stayed at The Cosmo, I ended every night/began each morning at Secret Pizza or ate there after an expensive app at Milos! The pizzas are cut into big, triangular slices & have the perfect ratio of thinness while still having some girth; softness for folding with a nice, crispy crust; and contains the perfect amount of grease to equalize the night's BAC! Definitely not the kind of 'Za I typically consume but what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas!  FYI: Secret Pizza also has a free, self-serve/purified water tank, sells beer & has limited seating, only countertops & some barstools, no tables. However, you can sit & eat at the couches by the pool table I mentioned above.   So if you're stayin' or playin' in The Cosmo, win,lose or draw, you will definitely wanna make Secret Pizza your last call! Cuz one thing is for sure, you can bet your ass, ya will friggin' eat it all!
502	0	I have eaten at places in Vegas that are pretty bad, but I haven't found a place that serves absolutely inedible food...until last night. The food here is HORRIBLE. I ordered the pad thai...and what do I receive? Something that resembles chinese chow fun, but tastes like plaster. It didn't even remotely taste like pad thai...or chow fun for that matter. My fiancee ordered the char shiu noodle soup. ALSO inedible. The noodles weren't even close to being fully cooked and were still HARD. The broth was sooooo salty...Morton's called them and is asking for their salt back. My friend ordered the chicken fried rice. The rice wasn't even fully steamed before frying so it tasted like pieces of gravel. I can't believe the Bellagio would allow a product like this to be sold on their property. I will never go back again. That place was complete ASS. (and expensive!)  Oh, and no refills on soda? What the hell is that???
503	0	2 stars for the atmosphere. That's all they get. I love the rose pedal bathtubs at the entrance, and the pink boxes that the go go girls sat in to look pretty. Even though I am a female myself, I could not stop staring at those girls inside. It reminded me of those windows in Amsterdam's Red Light District.   My group and I hit up Lavo first, and then to TAO after the promoter gave us wristbands for free entry to both places. We were probably in TAO for a total of 15 minutes. There were so many people inside, it was so difficult to get through in the main room that everyone just lined the walls and went around. Halfway through, I gave up because I wasn't getting anywhere. My friend said that they weren't allowing anyone else to enter the dance floor, wherever that was.   Then we all left. Maybe it was because our heels were killing us, or maybe it was because we did not enjoy the vibe at TAO, maybe it was both. But for now, I am not going back to TAO.
504	1	Found this gem on Yelp! Went here on a Wednesday about 6 P.M. The wait was not too bad. About 15 minutes. We were sat and then the magic began. We ordered the Meat Lovers meal and let me tell you, it was delicious. The food came out very fast. We were grilling in no time! What a fun experience! Definitely would have costed double on the strip.   *Tip: make a review and get a free dessert! What what!??
505	1	Wanted a special dinner with my beautiful BAE so I made reservations on Open Table. After watching Frozen Fury (LA Kings destroyed the Colorado Avalanche) we took a Uber to the Paris Hotel.  Our table was located upstairs. We had Matthew and Tony for our waiters. Our appetizers were the Gnocchi, Sriracha Roasted Broccoli and the Mac & Cheese. All three were delicious. As you can imagine the presentations were top notch.  Our main entrees were the 8 oz. Filet for me and the American Rib Cap for her. Amazing pieces of beef.   This was my first visit to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. I love his shows (Master Chef, Hell's Kitchen, Kitchen Nightmares) and now I can save I love his food. Can't wait to visit another one of his establishments.
506	1	Yes, it lives up to the hype. When you look at this place from the outside you might not be impressed, but when you look at the menu and try their food then you'll be a believer. Not only is this authentic Thai food, their selection is immense. Being my first time here I had a hard time deciding what to order, but going by other Yelper's reviews, I ordered:  - Nam Kao Tod (Appetizer): Selected 4 out of the 10 spiciness levels, seemed to be about right for me, but be wary, I saw some other tables sweating and downing drinks when they got too much spice. - Tom Kah Kai (Soup): Delicious, it has coconut milk on it which gives it a unique flavor, definitely worth a try. - Drunken Noodle Chicken & Pork Pad Se-Ew (Entrees): The noodles in both of this, out of this world. I personally likeD the Pork Pad Se-Ew better but they were both really good. - Nam Prik Ong (Red chilli dip): Never had it before, interesting to try, but wouldn't put it on top of my list. - Coconut ice cream with fried banana: I was so full I wasn't going to get dessert but other people were recommending it. It's definitely tasty, but I would rather save space for trying more dishes.  All in all, the food was absolutely amazing and this is what this place is all about. Kudos for them. Don't miss this place if you're ever in Vegas, it is quite the gastronomic tour-de-force.
507	1	I was introduced to this place by a friend while i lived in vegas for almost a decade. Located inside Mandalay Bay it is in their upstairs shopping area and has a great atmosphere. Service was great and booths are nice and roomy and four of us adults sat comfortably in there.  Burgers were great as were the sides and drinks. I ordered a custom made burger which does add up when you start piling on things like pineapple and different cheeses. Also added some foie gras to my burger which was delish.  The only gripe i have which i assume has nothing to do with the restaurant itself is that Yelp* has this as a $$ which i think it should be a $$$ considering there cheapest burger is in the $19 range. Other than that i have always had a great experience there and now that i live out of state Burger Bar is a must whenever i go to Las Vegas which is usually twice a year.
508	1	This place was great!...its not in one of the newer and hotter hotels on the strip (Paris), butnthe food and service were spectacular. I went with all the signatures and they didint disappoint.  Beef Wellington was tender, juicy and full of flavor and for dessert we had the Toffee pudding. MAN O MAN the thought of toffee flavored pudding put me off a little bit, but damn I was wrong, it might be one of the best desserts ive ever had. The drinks,apps, and service were top notch, I really recommend a visit.
509	1	Offering a sizable length of rope is a dangerous thing, especially when a high percentage of your clientele will hang themselves with it. At Burger Bar, the rope is a massive number of options for each and every component of your burger. That's thousands of burger permutations, many of which are truly awful.   Vegas is great for people watching and Burger Bar is great for burger watching: take note as Lance from Des Moines constructs his demon spawn burger and then complains about the resulting assault on his palette.   You'll also notice those deer-in-the-headlights expressions when patrons first get a look at the number of menu offerings. The Burger Bar staff will not jump-in with recommendations. Do not be surprised by this. They don't eat there. It is just not possible. They're all amazing fit.   Anyway, 5 stars for this combo: *  1/2 pound Angus Beef, medium rare * Whole Wheat bun * Sauted Mushrooms * Caramelized Onions * Blue Cheese  The Burger Bar beer menu is huge with many beers on tap, so pair your burger with a cold one and some thick cut fries.
510	0	The only reason I'm giving this place one star is because if i have it a ZERO my comments wouldn't get posted. I made my reservations 7 months in advance for a room with two queen beds. I called the hotel 3 days prior to my trip and confirmed my reservation, one room with two queen beds with a person at the front desk. When I arrived, I was told my reservation was for one King size bed. When I tried to explain to them that was incorrect, they told me I must have made the error while booking the room.   There were six people in our party and we individually booked three rooms with two queen beds for the same night. At check in, all six of us were told our reservations were for rooms with a single king bed. Although they brought up a roll away bed, no other compensation was given for their obvious booking error.   I asked to speak to a manager but no one was available. They took my name and number and to this day, no one from the hotel has called back. Do yourself a favor and stay at a Motel 6
511	1	Great place, great meal!!  Beautiful inside - looks like an authentic French restaurant. I had the prix fixe menu- house made garlic sausage in brioche, boeuf bourgenion (I can never spell that right) made with beef cheeks - one of the best dishes I have ever had - and a chocolate mousse with pistachio sauce to end.  Mrs had the same sausage starter and the moules frites.  All really good!
512	0	The lines around dinner and lunch time are always colossal, almost equally so to some of the people standing in them.  I was impressed by the variety of food available here when I managed to finally get in. I guess my choosiness allowed me to luck out and grab the best parts of the meatloaf and pot roast. However, even considering this, the foods seem to contain very high levels of salt. I had four glasses of water by the time I was done with my meal.  The service isn't bad for such a prodigiously crowded eatery but I won't be coming back until I hear about their food improving.  But, hey, at least it's cheap. It's dirt cheap compared to many restaurants in the area, although you can't expect too much.
513	1	Tried this place for the first time today, and I will definitely  be back. It's pretty pricey for me but definitely worth it. Love that they had burgers and ramen, my husband and kids enjoyed our meals.  Everything was so delicious and on top of that our server was awesome!!!! I'm all about good customer service and our server Dan made our first experience here even better!!!
514	1	Loved BurGR! My husband visited on our most recent Vegas trip, and we were very pleased. My hubby got the mushroom burger I don't remember the name but he loved it. And I had the hog burger, which was juicy and had a really good smokey pork flavor. My all time favorite though were the truffle fries and homemade ketchup and garlic aoli sauces. They are very addicting!   The atmosphere is clean and organized here, and the wait staff were great. We say right in front of the cool fire display.  I regret not trying the milkshakes, they looked really good. I will have to visit again and order one next time!
515	0	I was drawn into this hotel because of the $9.95 Prime Rib dinner 24/7 banner hanging on the side of their hotel!! DOH! It was okay-ish...my fault, I fell asleep at 5AM asking for this! All I can say is their wings suck arse...The tights gotta go under them orange shorts too, I never was a fan of that look LOL.  I guess I was only a fan of the Prime Rib, everything else was ehhh-whatevs!  I wasn't even aware of my surrounds at 4-5AM...sorry, there were bright lights and comfy cushions...I knocked out, but still remembered that the food sucked! LOL
516	1	Hands down the best steak place I've ever been to, although I may be biased being a fan of Gordon Ramsay. I'm not a huge meat lover to begin with and I've always felt meh about steaks especially (almost disliking them even), but I had high expectations for this place. I knew weeks ahead of time that I had wanted the beef wellington - the meat cart that they lug out to show their diners the different cuts? Wasn't even phased by it, though I found it awesome and very helpful since my boyfriend was unsure about the sizing of the different cuts. I was SUPER hyped to finally try the beef wellington after watching seasons upon seasons of Hell's Kitchen and seeing how difficult it was for those chefs to make one cute little beef wellington. Let me tell you, it definitely did not disappoint. I can't even describe the sensation I had as I put a cut of the meaty goodness into my mouth. It was as if all of my steak endeavors had finally reached an epiphany - that all other steaks I'd tried before had been subpar because I had been waiting for this moment of eating Ramsay's signature beef wellington. A true masterpiece. All I could do was moan about how delicious it was because I was speechless. I would recommend those who come here to definitely give it a try.  The other, less important, dishes we ordered were half a dozen oysters, the wagyu sliders, and my boyfriend got the American rib cap as his entree.   The oysters were alright. I'm a huge fan of oysters so I wanted to get them for myself but they're nothing spectacular or amazing. Definitely skippable unless, of course, you're dying to get your aphrodisiac on before hitting the club. I'm always trying to get my aphrodisiac on.  The American wagyu sliders come in 2 little burgers, perfect to split on a dinner date. They are delicious! Seasoned and cooked to perfection. I would recommend trying them! So cute and adorable.  My boyfriend really enjoyed his rib cap though I don't think it even compared to the beef wellington tbh if I say so myself, but again, I'm probably biased.  The complementary bread is also really good! We didn't get to try the walnut (?) one because my boyfriend is allergic to nuts, so we skipped that one, and the lemon one wasn't that great, but the two that are shaped like little muffins were amaze. I could eat those breads for days.  One thing that had me a little sad was that they don't do anything special for birthdays besides very briefly say, "Happy birthday!". Bummer.  Very expensive meal, dropped almost 3 bills, but very worth it. Will definitely come back the next time I'm in Vegas and try the mac n cheese.
517	0	WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!! This place got me hella sick!  A whole day in Vegas ruined!!!   Never eat the chili!!! Right after I ate the hotdog, my stomach was killing me.  I had the runs and I threw up. A whole night in Vegas spent lying in bed sick because of this.
518	0	The casino: It has my new favorite slot machine! Deal or No Deal.  There's something about opening up those silver briefcases that really gets your adrenaline going. It's awesome. Other than that, the casino is small and a little too smokey for me.   The restaurant: The service was super slow. It really shouldn't take that long to defrost chicken wings and slap some hot sauce on them. It took at least half an hour for our order to come out and when it did, our food was cold. Maybe it's because the Hooters girls were too busy taking pics with the bachelor party in the corner. The hot wings weren't very good anyway. I've had better ones at El Torito (which isn't saying much).
519	1	GREAT LOCAL FIND! Good place to eat. I love their drink selections, and their food. I'm a big fan of kimchee and beef so my favorite burger has to be the Kalbi burger. I also like the Ronin burger. I mean who doesn't love fried egg and katsu in their burger. Right? Their fries are awesome! I recomment the garlic parmesan fries are awesome. LOADED with flavor. Very garlicy and lost of parmesan in it if you like that. If you want to go for a softer tasting flavor for fries I'd say the sweet potatoes. Those go really well with the Kalbi burger. I also might suggest that you try at least ONE drink that isn't a coke or pepsi product. Their beverages are one of a kind, and tastey. So be brave! Try one of them. The feel of the place is very simple, hip, and urban. Easy enough. It doesn't have all the extra mumbo jumbo or glitz and glamour of the strip. So if you are looking for a casual place to eat with great service. Try it! I swear it is an experience!
520	1	LOVED this place!! I didn't eat at the restaurant as when we went there was quite a wait so we opted to sit fireside (in the lounge) and order drinks and apps.  First off the hostess and wait staff were friendly and helpful.  Our waitress answered all our questions about drinks and when one of the couples with us ordered the large nachos she recommended the small and boy am I glad she did because the small could easily feed 4-6.  The drinks were well priced and made well.  I opted for the Bloody Mary while the BF got The Scorpion (as seen on TV) - both were mighty tasty.  Our group not only had the nachos but also the BBQ sliders, ribs and the app sampler.  All were made really quick and tasted good.  There was even a photographer who came around and took group pics of us (free of charge).  We showed up around 4pm on a Friday and though the fireside table was reserved at 7pm the waitress politely notified us but didn't pressure us to leave or even move (which we did when more of our party showed up around 6:30pm).  All in all I give this place 5 stars and will be going back next time I'm in Vegas!
521	0	We tried 4 different dogs and they were ok at best. The buns weren't super fresh and the dogs themselves didn't taste great. The dogs were covered with toppings which probably helped to hide the bad taste of the dogs. But they had a wide selection and various types of hot dogs and sausages to pick from.
522	0	Mediocre at best.  The salad was generously sized but boring. My friend had a decent burger with OK fries. Two of us got a $15 glass of wine that was minuscule. They should cut back on the portions of their bland food and pour an average glass of wine.
523	0	Ugh. The friendly staff gets four stars but the building is atrocious. Decor is beyond tacky, elevators are scary, and the whole place needs an upgrade badly. Yeah, sure its cheap and not the MGM but the only reasons that I can think of anyone wanting to stay here is if they're really tight on budget or just want to ogle young girls in ridiculous outfits while gambling. At least the rooms don't seem to have bedbugs.
524	0	Paid for all you can drink out of beer only had wine.  They gentleman at the bar kept saying he would have some there soon . I did notice at the end of the meal they had some.  Food was under seasoned over cooked. My husband and I kept going back to try anything that was not dry overcooked. The root beer he ordered was flat.. Had a very difficult time finding anything that was palatable. Made a salad. Very disappointed. Service was nice that was the only positive I could come up with. This is our second time at this buffet we thought we would give it a second chance. We will never make that mistake again.
525	1	In fairness to the restaurants I haven't tried yet, I will not come out and say that this is the best burger in Vegas, but any of the selections here are some of the best I have had. Their beef mixture is very delicious and they can actually cook a burger medium to medium rare which is often a challenge for some reason at restaurants like this.  After some of the hype died down and the wait times weren't outrageous, Bachi Burger even became a place to get a reasonably quick meal as well.
526	1	Tell me where you can get a burger and ramen at the same time?  Zippy's? no you lolo, Zippy's has saimin, not ramen!  lol   If you're a fan of either a burger or ramen, come here.  If you're a fan of both, bring extra money lol. You could feed yourself in appetizers alone, but the Ramen and Burgers are something extra special here. Come hungry and don't be afraid to explore the menu, everything is onolicious.
527	0	This place sounded awesome: half mexican food half chinese.   They also have a noodle show where you see  some guy pull a piece of dough into noodles.   According to everything, hand pulled noodles are supposed to have excellent texture compared to machine made noodles and should be awesome. So i was super excited about the idea that maybe i won't have to fly to china to enjoy hand pulled noodle anymore.   Well I should've taken it as a bad sign when I asked the waitress for the dish with the hand pulled noodles and she looked at me like it was the first time she's heard of it.  She tells me the Unruly Monk dish should be the one that has it.   Next I also ordered a beef tongue taco.  As I waited for the food I watched the chef pull the noodles and then another bad sign. I realized he never once successfully finish pulling the noodles. Half way he would quit cause he messed up. For my entire meal he "finished" making noodles twice but he never brought them to the kitchen. They just sat there. Which made me wonder if the noodle show was just a show.  When the food arrived I was very sad. For 16 dollars you get the saddest amount of super soggy noodles. The texture would be described as noodles left in broth overnight.   The tacos were okay but you can totally have better ones in  downtown LA and at a wayyy better price. 9$ for two mini tacos?! that taste average?!   SAD SAD SAD whether or not the noodles were pulled in restaurant or not it was an all around disappointing meal.

529	1	WOW What can i say about this place other than it was amazing! I ordered the chill omelette which was amazing and it comes with potatoes. Also the banana nut muffin comes with this and this muffin was probably this best muffin i have ever had. The service was great even with the place being busy. Just a heads up your gonna have to wait especially on weekiends, it was definitely worth the wait and i will be back here every time I am in Vegas.
530	0	Let me start by saying this is my first negative review on yelp, and its because i dont want you to waste your money like us. I dont even know how this place has 3 stars. Nothing was even good about it. Our server waS good i feel bad he has to work for such a low quality restaurant. Save yo money people for a awesome brazilian steakhouse like texas de brasil
531	1	Meeting chef Scott!!!  Ordered the fish and chips.  The fish was the best I have ever had. The chips were not good.  The manager came and asked for feedback. He said they have been trying to perfect the chips and are still working on it. He was awesome, he send over 2 Carmel toffee desserts at no charge that were amazing!  The server was Alise and she was awesome!!  She event sent out chef Scott, as we really wanted to meet him.  I tasted my friends shepherds pie and it was very good.  The bangers and mash were good also.  I liked the branding and atmosphere.  Definitely will be a happy memory or this vacation.
532	1	Out of all the years I've been coming to the Peppermill it's been the same ever since I love this place but tonight tonight for some reason there are about 15 to 20 beautiful knock dead gorgeous women here they don't know me from Adam or all they want to do is go out and partay I'm down for that taxi all later O
533	0	See Photo for Tequila Recommendation.  Came here twice this last year.  Location is nice.    1st time: Food/Service for the food.....Not really that great.  I tried to eat here and left because the service was lacking.  Waters were not filled.  Food came cold and without condiments we needed like salsa and when we asked for it, the server forgot about us.   2nd Time: They earned an extra star because of Groupon. They had a special for $15 for $30 worth of food or drinks. The best part was that for some reason Groupon only charged $1! I was like What??? I don't care how bad, the place was before...Dollar for drinks? I'm in. I purchased 2!    Apparently it was some mistake, but Groupon honored it and I came armed with $30 to spend.  Went straight to the bar and got two $14 shots of tequila that came in a Worm shaped  bottle.  Smooooooooth. So if you come armed with the Groupon or not get the Tequila in the Worm Bottle. You will not regret it. Skip the food.  Hagar earned the extra star for the Worm Bottle Tequila Basically and the nice bartender.  Didn't have time to use the other Groupon on that trip...but Worm Tequila...I'm coming back for you!!!
534	1	Las Vegas' worst kept secret!  In a sea of overpriced food and tiny portions, it's nice to have a cheaper alternative that still tastes good! It's hard to beat $5/slice on the strip! $22 for the whole pie!  You can find this pizza place inside The Cosmopolitan. There is no sign. There is no name. Just a hallway leading to a small room that serves some damn good pizza!  This place really honors the New York style pizza. Thin crust at its finest! I usually don't like eating the crust at the end, but I couldn't get enough of it! There's just enough crust, but their crust is so flavorful. I could eat just a whole pie of that crust!  Their white pizza is the best!! Three different kinds of cheese with no red sauce. Sooooo good! It's like the best cheesy bread you'll ever have! I love the dollops of fresh ricotta that's on it. Their red sauce options are pretty good also, but the white pizza is the best!  By the way, they're open ridiculously late! Totally awesome after a night of drinking at the club! Unfortunately, I didn't find out about this place until the last day of my trip, so I didn't get to taste how freakishly awesome their pizza must taste while drunk.   There's a line here during peak hours! But the wait is toooootally worth it!
535	0	This was my first time at a Hooters.. I know right? Like how can I have never visited a Hooters. lol. But I regret trying the wings for my very first time at the Casino. I love wings, but I felt that the taste was not that great. Are the wings over rated? The service was even not impressing.
536	1	FOIE GRAS FOR A CALIFORNIAN  Anyone who's read my profile knows my love for foie gras. Because of the California ban on foie gras it is very difficult get this delicacy. After the ban the last time I had foie gras was when Psycho Donuts in San Jose were giving free foie gras donuts. Yesterday on my last night at Vegas I came here for dinner. There were two items I had in mind: 1) Hudson Valley Foie Gras 2) Beef Wellington. I waited in anticipation for both items. The first dish was the foie gras. When I took a bite of this foie gras it reminded me when I last had foie gras at a California restaurant after the ban - it was at Boulevard in San Francisco. I took my time eating this foie gras. I cut the foie gras into thin slices. I placed the thin slices of foie gras with the bite sizes of pumpkin waffle. This provided a typical contrast of savory and sweet texture. I treated this foie gras dish as if it was the main dish. The main dish the Beef Wellington takes about 45 minutes to cook. I never had Beef Wellington before and it was worth the wait. The pastry had that golden crust. The beef was cooked perfectly medium rare. Some people think a steak that is medium rare is too red. I never understood some people's fascination of a well done steak. For the amount of money you pay for a great quality steak why destroy the quality of the meat. What I love about the Beef Wellington that it's only cooked one way - medium rare only. Chef Ramsay is making the statement that customers have to adjust to him and not the other way around. The customer is not always right. Overall having dinner at Gordon Ramsay Steak with a chance to have foie gras was great way to have dinner on my last night in Vegas.
537	0	Was with a group of business colleagues for a pre-set meal. The service was excellent, but the food left a lot to be desired. Chicken Piccata was flavorless and served on a bed of pasta that was even more bland. Others shrugged off their food (steak and Cannelloni)with a "Meh, not so good." I had expected much better.  Chocolate raspberry cake was yummy.
538	0	Food: 1/5 Service: 3/5 Cleanliness: 4/5 Decor & Style: 5/5  The quality has really gone down hill since I first started coming here when it first opened. The pizza tasted like a frozen pizza from walmart as well as the wings. The deserts are not as fancy as they use to be. The location is still great so I may just stop by for beer next time, never the food! The place was approximately 75% empty at 6 o clock on a Thursday. I remember back then it was crowded and I had to wait in line. I really question how long this place will stay open!
539	0	Not a fine dining of course, it's more of a causal grab a bit kind of place. The Singaporean noodle was good. Spring rolls were average. I expected a bit more from the place in terms of food quality in lieu of it being in Bellagio. PS mango pudding was okay too!
540	1	Great service, delicious and fresh food (e.g. the squid in seafood pancake was supreme tender and fresh).would definitely return,but come earlier or.later to avoid the prime time. Only 11 regular tables so easy to end up with an hour wait. Totally yummy and worth it though!
541	0	Ok, here is the truth. This place is about the same price as the Bellagio Buffet (which is now my standard for all buffets) and the quality was like Old Country Buffet. The variety was lacking, the service was non existant and the food tasted bad. The only thing that gave this two stars was the crepes. We didn't have to pay since it was comped and even then I wouldn't go again. GROSS!!!
542	0	What can I say positive here.  We were seated right away. Went at 9pm on a Sunday night.  Not too crowded but had to wait about 5 minutes or more just to have someone come and take a drink order or offer water.  This place is not concerned with service at all.   Decor was okay but you are seated really close to other people and there wasn't a lot of room if you are making trips to the salad bar.  We had questions about the menu.  They do a table side sliced meat deal... they call it a "parade of meats".  They run between $48.95 to $54.95 including their "50 item hot and cold salad bar".  The rest of the menu was priced high too.    Funny thing about the service... when the came to offer my husband his first "slice of meat"... he didn't even have a plate... when we asked about getting a plate... they told him he had to go get one at the salad bar.  REALLY... you want to charge someone $48.95 for a meal and you have to go get your own plate.  WHAT???  (okay, so we had a $10 off coupon but still... if I am paying $$$$ for a meal.. I want real service)  I had the boulliabase (small over cooked split lobster tails, about 6 shrimp and a lot of mussels over pasta in a broth) which also came with the all you can eat salad bar ($39.95).  Over all... was only mediocre and I ddin't even take my unfinished pasta back to our place.  Mhusband had the "meat parade"  which included pork tenderloin, tri tip which he like, filet (parmesean crusted), a dried out chicken thigh, ham, sirloin, and some bacon wrapped turkey I think.  My kids had the sirloin and the tenderloin (around $35 each as well).    Even with coupons, $150 for 4 people, no desert and only one glass of wine... so not worth it.
543	1	5 Stars, and here is why....  1.  If the restaurant closes at 10pm, and you can still roll in at 9:55pm for a meal - Good.  The service is still excellent - Better.  The quality of the food is still exceptional - Best.  Lotus is tops on all three accounts!  2.  Wine List and Pairing.  Not only does Lotus have an outstanding wine list, it has the largest selection of German Whites in any restaurant - in the world, if memory serves.  Also, any restaurant whose wait staff knows wine enough to pair with my meal makes me happy.  However, despite the large number of Sommeliers and wannabes in Las Vegas, I rarely find a member of the general wait staff who can confidently assign a wine to my meal without looking at the price or without pairing  by color.  3.  Of course, the food!  I know that I've enjoyed a Larb Salad in another place better, but not an entire Thai meal.  To start, three of us ordered the Hot Pot-sized Thom Kha Kai, a wonderful coconut and lime-based soup with mushrooms and chicken, which was simply pleasing.  It was creamy, tart, sweet and savory; so perfectly balanced that it could have easily satisfied me as a main course.  Next, a Larb Salad (Chicken).  This could have been better to my taste, but was well-seasoned with mint and onions and very aromatic.  Finally, the main course - Nua Yang Panang.  I love Panang curries, and this one, with its embellishment of cognac, was one of the best I've ever had.  The sauce was so good my friends and I made balls of rice to sop up every last bit - the dishwasher got off easy with us!  4.  Price.  Yes, you can spend (and maybe should spend :)) $30-40/ person at Lotus of Siam.  Yes, you can probably make decent curries at home now without the time and expense thanks to the plethora of bottled Thai sauces - think Heinz 57 of Thai...blegh!  But the total bill for all of us including my $10 glass of Piesporter, the menu listed in #3 and another's fried rice, just cleared $60 with tax.  That's right folks $15 a person!  Can you eat at any other of the World's 100 Best Restaurants at dinner for $15?  I think I hear Thomas Keller laughing...nervously...  Bottom line:  Well, worth the drive from anywhere for the excellent quality, selection and service.  A super way to dine at one of the World's Best!
544	0	Wow.  Wish I had checked Yelp before eating here.  The place is kinda neat looking - bunch of little goldfish, some of which swim upside down (for fun??)  Food is terrible.  Don't be fooled by the cheong-sam dressed Asians they have at the front.  Actually, that should have been a warning sign.  It being a "Chinese restaurant" in Caesar's should have been warning enough.  The place advertises itself as "authentic" hand-pulled noodles.  Yes, it's noodles.  And NO, it ain't authentic.  Supposedly their "best-seller" was the hand pulled noodles with shrimp/pork wontons.    The noodles were the WORST I have had in a long time.  Soggy, sad, thin little things with no texture.  Wontons were nothing to write home about.  Soup was on par with Cup O Noodles broth.  A relatively small bowl of -- blah -- for:                                          ****   $17.00  ****  Tip: DON'T GO.  Or, if you must go, don't expect authentic food.  (ps - the one star is for the cute fish!)
545	1	This place is hidden behind the clear/silver elevator across from STK.  It's not on any maps & it's down a hallway.  They had the best think crust pizza.  If you don't like pizza sauce they have a "white" slice and it has no tomato sauce.  Just cheese & garlic.  It's only $3.50 for a slice, however the soda in a red cup is the SAME price.  I thought that was a bit  much.  As soon as you come up the escalator stay straight ahead and you'll see it .
546	0	I am really torn on this one...a cool club, nice decor, cool enough hosts.  The bottle service thing is a racket in itself...but I was overcharged and in my ummmm....altered state I failed to see that I was overcharged by a bottle (what's $450 between friends right?).  Easy enough to correct right?  Call the club, fix it, done...right?  WRONG.  I was told that because I signed the tab...tough luck...even though the staff REMEMBERED NOT SERVING ME THE EXTRA BOTTLE!!!  Best they could do was comp me a bottle next time I am in Vegas...gee thanks...I would have gone back anyway, but now its like....will go back again after collecting the comp?  Quick update, I finally made it back to Vegas and called to set up the bottle I paid for back in March...of course the manager I worked with is no longer there, and they refused to do anything besides assuring me of a "really nice table"...um you basically stole from me....  Shame on me for not being more careful and assuming my bill was prepared correctly...  Spend your money elsewhere is my recommendation.
547	1	I returned again.  This time for breakfast.  The hostess was a turn off upon my check in.  The dark hair hostess was stone face and unwelcoming at guest arrival.  Poor attitude! Once seated, all services are back to normal.  My waiter is very informative and won't give in until I hear him out of all options.  I went with his recommendation at the end.  It was the right decision.  You will not go wrong with the bakery plate ($13 for four selections).  The sticky bun is a must have.  The rest are all awesome.  Get more downstairs at the bakery for to go.  My corn beef hash was meaty and not oily.  My soft broiled eggs were made perfectly.  Skilled!  However, the coffee is was little weak and lack of flavor for such a strong restaurant.  All in all, I am pleased with my breakfast at my favorite LV restaurant.
548	1	Holsteins was amazingly good. I had the Gold Standard, medium rare. The meat was flavorful, the bun was perfectly toasted and fresh. The bacon and goat cheese and the tomato tied the whole thing together. This is one of the best burgers that I have had. I enjoyed every bite and would of ate (2). My wife had the Machete. I took a bite and tasted: spiciness, crunch and freshness. It's evident that the burgers here are well balanced with a fantastic flavor profile. All in all, the food, decor and service was an experience that my wife and I enjoyed. If you are in Vegas, do yourself a favor and check this place out, you will not regret it.
549	1	This spot is GREAT from top to bottom and man on man they do some business there. From the Shakes to the Buns to the massive beer list and Adult Vitamins and the wonderful, addictive and creative desserts... it's on! I love it and all of my friends love it. I've been several times and each time we all have fun, which is worth any price... and these prices are more than worth it. Love It!
550	1	The people are right!  The food is fantastic and the coffee is great.  Strong and not for the light hearted. I asked about the chicken and waffles but was told the chicken Benedict was the most popular dish so I ordered it.  It can easily feed two and maybe even three people.  Everything was delicious and the portions are obscenely huge.   The wait was worth it although we heard the closer to 9am the more likely you'll get seated quickly. We arrived in Sunday at 11am and had to wait 30 minutes.
551	0	Heard the frozen hot chocolate hype so had to try one with half oreo and half mochaccino flavors.  It tasted like chocolate ice milk with whip cream and a couple coffee bean candies and some crushed oreos on top ... which is fine.... but to me the atmosphere ruined the whole experience.  The tables seemed too close together and small ... at least where we were seated (directly across from the kitchen).  It also seemed a bit on the dirty side.  There was such an overwhelming scent of ketchup in the air, it ruined my desire for anything chocolatey.  Also, I wanted to wash my hands before eating and had to go outside of the restaurant, pass the patio area, and down some cavernous cement hallway to use a restroom.  I was expecting an elegant, old-timer ice cream parlor feel, but this place is no where near that. I can't imagine buying the $1000 sundae here. There were a bunch of teens hanging around a cash register by the door which was confusing because the waiter who just left the check didn't specify if he was going to take the payment or if we were to pay at the cash register by the door.  Sooo after waiting around awhile, we stood by the cash register while they asked us what our waiter looked like and then gave the payment to him.  No eye contact, "thanks", "come back again" from the waiter...so we just walked out. Overall I felt like I was just at a fast food place, but with exorbitant prices, grumpy waiters, & pretty plates.
552	0	We stopped in for a quick dessert and cup of coffee and it was anything but quick. The staff was not very friendly and the wait was simply unacceptable. 20 minutes for a piece of mediocre chocolate cake. I am willing to wait in a long line and pay extra for good service and great food, but not this. Don't waste your time and money!
553	0	It's was a very bad experience at this restaurant. Celebrating our sons 21st bday.  The customer service was the worst Ive ever experienced. As we entered and got seated it seemed to be ok and funny!  We understood the concept of this restaurant 100%.  We read the is and isn't board before entering.  There might have been poor judgement on the waitress behalf and we were treated very poorly. She turned us over to another waitress and one person from our party was singled out and no service for that person.  The waitress out load called someone from our party rude and uncalled for names. If they didn't want to serve us as a whole party for whatever reason we should have been asked to leave and given a reason for such actions. There was absolutely no reason to have been treated as we did. We didn't even get a manager to come over.  This waitress served many tables around us and introduced herself and explained the concept. It was not done to us.  It was very uncomfortable and was too late to leave. Will not recommend this restaurant to anyone.
554	0	BED BUGS This place has BED BUGS. I was in room 4826 and there were bed bugs. I got bit and they were in my hair. They moved me to a new hotel room, but did not refund my cost of staying there, and I am STILL trying to get compensated for my dry cleaning, loss of luggage and personal items, plus measures to keep contamination from coming to my house. Then they had the audacity to tell me that they inspected the room and found it not active.   This was after their security guy took away a few bugs in a jar that I had found, after I took photos of the bites, and filled out a "report" which was actually a comment card. I've been getting the  run around from security and risk management since January 22nd. Their staff is rude and basically lied to me about this room being "non active".   Don't stay here! If you get even one bug in your luggage and take it home, it can grow into an infestation that will cost thousands to get rid of! You'll have to heat treat your home, use bug dogs, vapor strips, mattress encasements, it will put you out for their negligence! I lost my luggage, comb, a pair of shoes, etc. and am out costs because this crappy hotel is unwilling to fess up to their dirtiness!   I've given the Riviera up until now to deal with this problem and be honest, but they refuse, so I am going to post pix here!
555	1	So we ate here for the first time and had breakfast. We ate the chicken and waffles (w/ bacon inside!) and the Man vs. Food Fried Chicken Benedict. I prefered the Man vs. Food order vs. the chicken and waffles only because some of the chicken was dry. The Fried Chicken Benedict was so yummy. The chicken soaked up the sauce on the plate. There were biscuits, scrambled eggs, hashbrowns and sauce along with the chicken. Really great service! The staff really seems to love their job. Lots of locals there too. Hoping to go back for lunch and dinner too while here on vacation!
556	1	So far this is the best pizza I've ever had.  I really like thin crust NY style and this is definitely it.  The place can be found on the third floor of The Cosmopolitan Hotel, right by the exit from Marquee.  The best IMO is the white pizza...I tried the mushroom and it was just OK.  It's $4 a slice which is reasonable, if you think it's a rip-off what the hell are you doing at the Cosmo in the first place??
557	0	You either love this place or you don't get it.  The service was good, the gimmicks and insults are funny.  But the drinks were subpar, especially to be so pricey.  And the food was not really that great.  Go for the funny hats, but don't order from the bar, and try to stick with an app.
558	0	The absolute worst Vegas hotel I have ever stayed in.  The room was filthy, the hallway was filthy. The entire complex smelled like cigarettes. They tried to mask the smell in the long hallway by installing huge chemical air fresheners that added to the overall stench. The air conditioner was loud and made sporadic noises all night. There were no accessible wall outlets for charging a cell phone. I had to move the bed to reach an outlet. The outlet was literally not connected to the wall and was a fire waiting to happen. If I could give less than 1 star I would. Horrible, horrible, horrible.
559	1	Can you say the BeSt PiZzA eVeR!   If someone never told you about the secret pizza place you'd never know this place existed.  Luckily I came across a video on YouTube and had to give this place a shot.   When you find this place it's very small inside. Maybe enough to seat 4 or 5 people. The pizza is excellent and surprisingly not many were here.   Out of all the places we ate on our recent Vegas trip this was one of our favorite.
560	1	Best burger I've ever had. Usually burgers (even from a "nice" place) are so salty and greasy, but these burgers weren't like that at all. I didn't feel ill or uncomfortably full afterwards, and all the food was delicious. They quoted us an hour wait for the table, but it was ready in 25 minutes. The server was extremely friendly and even brought me a treat for my birthday.
561	0	Never have I been so dissatisfied with a dining establishment. The only thing more awful than the food, was my server, Lucy. We waited for 30 minutes to be sat (which I was fine with), THEN we waited about 45 minutes for tacos that tasted like they we're fresh  out of the microwave.  Twice, I had to get up to find my server so I could order drinks & both times she seemed like she was bothered. (Do your job girl, then your customers won't have to). I am usually not a tough critic when it comes to resteraunts, or service but senior frogs deserves ZERO stars. The only reason I am even giving them one star is because there is a nice view of the strip outside. Five thumbs down for seor frogs.
562	0	We chose to go here the day after the Las Vegas marathon because Mexican is always a good day after race meal because it's filling and we are usually starving.   I know it's Vegas and all but the fact that they want you to pay $4 to start off for chips and salsa is a bit crazy especially given that it's a Mexican restaurant. We ordered margaritas and I have to say that this was the worst $13 margarita I have ever had. It tasted so sicky sweet that it was undrinkable. It was almost as if it was all simple syrup mix and no alcohol.   We ordered the steak nachos and thankfully the waitress was wise enough and kind enough to tell us that the nachos would be enough to feed both of us. Boy was she right! We are by no means gals who eat like birds and these nachos could have easily fed 3 of us. So if you want to get your money's worth definitely order the Nachos. There is a nice heaping of guacamole on the top of these which is some decent guac but they are lacking in sour cream - there's very little drizzled across it. (I asked for some extra but it never showed up.) When we asked for some salsa for the nachos we were told it would be an additional $4.  Guys you'll be happy to know that the girls are dressed in a "bad girl" theme and are all pretty attractive. Our waitress was nice enough but the service was still lacking. I'm not sure where in Vegas the other Mexican places are but there has to be something better.
563	1	What more is there to say that hasn't already been said? Yes it's Gordon Ramsay's, just go! Go if you are a fan, go if you enjoy burgers and mostly go if you would ever want a chance to see him. I asked our waiter and he said that Ramsay himself shows up about every 3 weeks. He did mention that there are about 200 people or so who also want a chance to see him-so now you know!  Other than that I do personally recommend that You order your burger medium RARE! The meat is as tender and juicy as it looks in the picture.  The jalapeo shots are a good group appetizer. Yes they are spicy-as they should be!  The order of fries and onion rings are big enough to share with someone else!  Another tip! Before you ever appear on one of his shows Make sure you learn how to cook a scallop and Wellington properly! :p
564	0	Gross! I ordered grapefruit bowl and side of yogurt. My strawberries were rotten and disgusting looking. My uncle's steak potato plate had a dark curly long hair in it. Probably a woman's hair, and our server was male so the kitchen must be dirtay! Server seemed annoyed, not good hospitality. Customer is always right. We didn't complain there b/c family isnt like that
565	1	BEST THAI FOOD IN LAS VEGAS! This place is seriously amazing. It's off the beaten path in a pretty suspicious plaza. This place is always busy, we got there ten minutes before they opened on a Sunday for dinner and there was at least twenty people in line. It's totally worth any wait though. They have an impressive wine selection (a lot of rieslings) and everything on their menu is great. I always go with the Pineapple fried rice, spice level 8. It's so flavorful and the pineapple adds the appropriate amount of sweetness to offset the spiciness. A great appetizer is the crispy rice or the garlic wings. Seriously, you need to get the wings. The fried garlic is mouthwatering and the wings are so crispy. It's totally worth the trek over, if you're in Las Vegas and don't eat here you're making a mistake.
566	0	This review comes down to a customer service issue. Two of the rudest people I've ever encountered were behind the desks at the MGM. Calling down to the front desk, I spoke to Raven.. And wow, I was blown away by how abrupt and rude she was, clearly no one ever taught her any manners growing up. I'm in disbelief that she's in a position where she interacts with customers at all. The second person was also at the front desk. I feel bad judging the hotel by these two individuals but they really soiled the trip for me. The only saving grace was Katie from the front desk, faith restored. The housekeeping ladies were also really nice people. Even though Katie was a complete sweetheart, I will not be staying there again. It's not worth the hassle of dealing with those unpleasant people and the rooms are mediocre at best.
567	0	My beef isn't so much the  actual taste of the food it's more like the portion and cost.  I know, I know after all this is Las Vegas so everything is priced three times what it usually should cost. It is completely beyond me how people can charge this much for food. During this particular visit I arrived with seven other guests three of which were menly men (like these boys could eat). One of them even asked which is your largest meal and the waiter responded with Twenty Vegetable Fried Rice. Judging by it's miniture size I doubt it actually had twenty vegetables it was probably named that cause it cost close to twenty dollars!   Next up is the Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich it is braised red pork in a chinese flat bread. It was tasty but a bit on the salty side and was almost half the size of my iphone!   Then my hunny and I split the Shrimp Mojo per the waiter's recommendation. It was packed full or flavor and mouthwatering good. It was $16 for eight pieces.  Again my complaint isn't towards the taste or quality of the food mainly the portions. The service was good we were seated within 10 minutes for a party of eight while other places had hour long wait times. The restaurant decor and arrangement was very chic and trendy. But after loosing my butt in the casino I doubt I'd be able to pay for a substantial lunch here!
568	1	Rib cap steak medium well was the best dinner of my life. Meat was tender, juicy, flavorful, perfect in every way imaginable. We had dinner at New York New York Gallagher steak house and all I could say that I will never go back to that place. Bad food bad meat ok service
569	1	I am a fan! I have heard about Bachi Burger forever and was happy to see it and when I drove by, made a U turn!  The way I judge a burger is by the flavor of the meat. I cannot eat gluten so I do not get to have the joy of a bun, so when a burger is seasoned well it is a pleasure for the palate. Bachi Burger does it oh so right that I did not miss the bun. I was in heaven. We both ordered the Kiki Burger, and I wish one would have tried a different one but I now have a reason to return! The meat,the carmelized onions, mushrooms and cheese was pure decadence. I give the server props for letting me know the sauce was not gluten free! That was a touch I truly appreciated. I also liked that there was extra lettuce to make up for the bun, it is a great touch because it is annoying to pay the same for getting less. It was just juicy and oh so good.  We shared the oxtail fries. They were very good and the portion is very large. In fact, half came home. The meat was tender, flavorful and a nice kick. It was too spicy for my Mom even without the jalapeos but I was happy to finish them off. Next time if I ordered the fried it could be with another side as it was too much food! I want to try the other fries as well, so I will be returning'  I hear it is busy all the time, so as far as service goes I suggest not going at peak service as it is not large, so one may have to wait for excellence.The concrete floors and high ceiling makes it a little noisy but that is also the urban vibe. We had one main server but several different servers and busses came by to make sure we were taken care of!  The is one of the best burgers I have ever had, 5 Stars!
570	0	The concept of this place is crazy.  It's also bordering on criminal to charge $4 and up per taco regardless of how good the ingredients are.  The Chinese food well let's just put that aside.   The tacos are pretty good but seriously these prices are absurd even by Vegas standards especially the portion size.  I can get tacos in many places in LA or OC for $1.25 that are many times superior (2 Guys, Taco Leo).  Taking aside these huge issues the tacos are good but not as authentic - I don't care how many abuelas you have making toritllas in the front of the house.  The Chinese food is like a more authentic version of PF Chang but dim sum style.  Again the food is tasty but about 3x in price of much better stuff I can get in dozens of places in SGV.   The Bazaar is great this place is just weird and expensive.
571	0	As a vegan, I could only really judge on the selection of veggies and random vegan-friendly items. Buffets are usually my time to get creative with what is available to me. The Spice Market Buffet looked especially fun since it featured your basic global cuisines.  At the salad bar I stocked up on grilled bell peppers, asparagus, brussel sprouts, olives, and other veggies that were not very memorable. Next I perused the Mexican food bar in hopes to top certain veggies with guacamole. Unfortunately, the guacamole looked sad, grey, and machine processed.  The Mid-Eastern bar looked much more promising while I filled my plate with hummus, dolmas, tabouli, pita, and if I remember correctly, some kinda of zucchini dish.  Overall, I was glad that there was a sufficient amount of options for me. However, all of it tasted as if these options were after thoughts. Nothing very exciting here. To top it off, the staff all had this "FML" attitude about themselves. From the cashiers to the hostess to the servers. Geez, get a better job if you all hate it so much.  The next day we went to Le Village Buffet at Paris which was way better food, service, and atmosphere. It made The Spice Market Buffet look like a Sizzler.
572	1	I had the farm burger, great combination of creamy yolk and crispy duck great bacon over a medium well patty(my preference) and a side of truffle fries! The aioli is really delicious. They update their menu too. so the next time you check this restaurant, You may find a new burger on the menu
573	1	Jeremy was our server and Scott had no problem jumping in to help. Theses two guys were fabulous. They were friendly and attentive. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was perfect for my 9 years old. We've been here quite a few times, but the service this time was definitely something to yelp about. We will continue to return to this restaurant.
574	1	WOW. I can safely say we ordered everything on the menu and ATE EVERYTHING! Our favorites were the sukiyaki beef noodles, original bibimbap, spicy pork, squash tempura, and the free side of tofu. Amazing value, and this review got me a free macaroon dessert!
575	0	Literally in the middle of our meal right now & couldn't wait any longer to rate the experience... the best part of the meal was the music. The service was terrible, 2 of 5 orders were wrong, took 20mim to correct the order & food was average at best. Its quite unfortunate because we had such high hopes. The manager was "kind" enough to hear me out on my complaint, but his resolution was his business card, so that I could call him next time for a better experience.  But hey they have a nice view of the city...
576	1	Love going to Burger Bar at Mandalay Place.  Great selection of different burgers from the buffalo patty to the Kobe along with a large selection of toppings and offerings.  I've had the American Classic many times with cheese and bacon for a nice juicy burger.  The hangover burger is great with the coleslaw topping and it definitely helps after a night of drinking as its name suggests.  Full service bar to eat when dining room is full is a plus and the friendly staff make sure the order is right every time.  The onion rings are super crispy and cooked to perfection every time.  Sometimes I'll do the fat fries that complements the burger of choice well.  Great place to watch current sports events while dining on a delicious burger.  The mini tvs located in the dining booths are a great idea and makes it feel like watching tv at home and having a meal.
577	0	Over priced food for less than sufficient portions. ex: $12 for 6 small pieces of "shu mai" dumplings.  I can do without the gold flakes and just pay at most $3 for it.  I like salty food, but the chinese food here is way too salty.    Also, what's up with the names of the asian dishes?  Each dish name sounds like a Kung Fu movie...With these names, you have to sit there and read the entire description of the dish before you know what you're ordering.  For example...they had a dish called "swallow a cloud," um...why can't you just call it wonton noodle or something similar to the dish so it's easier to recognize.  I understand it may "fun" names...but it's not run having to sit there and read every single dish.
578	0	Never again!!!    We purchase the deal through Travelzoo before we arrived. When we sat down, the waiter acted like he didn't know what the deal it was at first.  He kept looking then took a scanner out of his pocket and acknowledged it then explained the terms of it.  He definitely didn't seem to happy about it.  He asked if we had been before and I tried to explain that Chicago has one kind of like it.  He cut me off then said ok...salad bar is up there.   We were sitting near the bar and had to weave between other tables, waiters, and other guests to get there.   The plates were dirty and the salad bar was sloppy.  The floor is unbelievably slippery.  When we arrived back to our table, there was a very pretty and obviously pricey bottle of spring water on our table. I awkwardly asked the waiter that I just wanted tap water and he said fine and took it off our table.  The meats were ok...some were great, some not.  Two other tables filled next to us while we were there with similar deals and he acted the same.   The poor lady next to us had no clue how the process worked and was asking us because the waiter didn't explain it.   If you want a relaxing and pleasant experience, don't come here.
579	1	About a 15 minute wait for a table on a Sunday, but it was well worth the wait!! The biscuit and gravy breakfast was delicious! The gravy was a tad salty, but still good. The biscuit was amazing! Fluffy, thick, and perfect. The potatoes seemed to come with just about any breakfast dish and they were great, crispy and they had a great seasoning on them. My husband had the Cincy chili. He said that was great as well. The service was exceptional, especially considering how busy they were! Definitely putting on my list of must visit places in Vegas!
580	0	It was the third day away from NYC food in combination of eating Vegas style steak+eggs-ish meals .... Noodles really hit the spot, even at $15 a small bowl of noodle soup (which would easily cost $3.75 in NYC chinatown).  The food here isn't your typical Americanized chinese take-out.  Believe me, there is NO SUCH THING as sweet & sour pork or general tso's chicken in real chinese cuisine....  Noodles is on par in terms of taste.  If a restaurant can make money, have customers return, and write good reviews by serving food with 800% mark-up, bravo to you, seriously.  And for that, I refuse to give more than 2stars for such an establishment.   The only complaint I had was the bowls were rather small compare to what I'm use to (Universal order of #1 at any Viet pho restaurant.... Taiwanese noodle shops... or even Korean naengmyun noodle bowls), and they don't give you much broth.    Being that I was pretty sick of buffet foods and rich french (Vegas-style) cuisine easily price at $40+ per person, paying $15 a bowl of noodles was fulfilling.  PS - my Chinese parents would have died and hit themselves in the face with bokchoy and hot sauce if they knew I spent $50+ for a bowl of duck noodle soup, chicken congee, and roti canai.  Seriously, yo.
581	1	Located on the 3rd floor of The Cosmo, you will find a long, dark hallway covered with old schooled vinyl records that will lead you to the secret pizza joint! One of my favorites. You can order by the slice, which is $5/pop, or what I usually do is order the whole pizza back to the room to eat. It's definitely worth it even if there's only 2 people because you can always microwave it for another time! Be sure to call and place your take-out order about 40 minutes in advance to avoid any lines! They have an assorted variety to choose from, but my favorite is their white pizza, which is filled with garlic, cheese, and olive oil. Perfect after a long night of drunken fun!
582	1	Probably my favorite pizza in all of Sin City. Secret Pizza is great, and it's not just because the pizza is stellar. The staff is nice and there's always some entertainment in the form of drunken twenty somethings if you're into people watching. Try the white pizza...it's life changing.
583	0	Sigh... this was not the first time I've eaten here, however, it was the worst visit out of my two visits. Fortunately, both meals were free. The silver lining...  I'd like to give more than 2 stars but I can't. It was really more like a 2.5 experience, but I can't round up because the food was just that lousy.  The only thing that was half way decent was the prime rib, fruit tart, lemon meringue tart, and the stuffed sole. All of the warm items were cold...selections were dim...meats were all tough except for the ones that I just mentioned. Not sure what happened at the Mediterranean station. Why was everything doused in heavy curry spice?? Isn't curry more of an Asian spice?? The curried cauliflower and chicken were both awful. All that I could taste was heavy curry and no other seasonings..really dreadful dishes...the lamb and chicken kabobs were both dry and cold. The grilled squash was cold, slimy and tastless... I could go on and on about the other items that I tried, but I won't bore you with details, but I will tell you that the other offerings were similar. I didn't get around to the salad bar but I think I should have started there first...  I think that SMB is right around $40 per person sans discounts...it's definitely not worth the money. Quality nor selection are there. There are too many other buffets in Vegas that offer much better food at a better price. The Orleans is one.  In all fairness, I'm not a buffet buff, but this is about as bad as it gets...service was at least decent.
584	0	What a joke of an establishment.   Rude staff. 20 minutes for a drink order. Aloof when taking order. Aloof when bringing food. Sarcastic when asking if we needed anything else.   Disgusting food. That's a tough thing for me to say because never would I say food is disgusting if it truly wasn't.   Cold fries. Who the hell serves up cold fries nowadays?!  Onion rings made out of the outer rind of the onion. You know, the first layer under the peel? Yeah that tough one that you don't eat.   Fish tacos. What a joke! Raw and cold.   Wagyu sliders. Dry like the Vegas desert. It was so bland it was comical.    Will never ever ever step foot here nor recommend it to anyone. Don't waste your time. For vegas being the home to fantastic dining, do not! For the price of this place, go to a fabulous steakhouse instead.  And to the "chefs" working that night-- shame on you! If there was an ounce of pride in what you do, it wouldn't have reflected so damn POORLY in what was served! Shame on you!
585	1	This is the best burger joint in Vegas. Had the hell's fire burger, sweet potato fries, wings for appetizer and a chocolate shake. Everything tasted fresh. Burger was great size and cooked to perfection. Sweet potato fries were so good and were sprinkled with powdered sugar. Wings were amazing. Service was awesome.  Will definitely come back.
586	0	After deciding to take an impromptu trip to Vegas, my hubby and I booked the Riviera  through Expedia.com, so we could save some money on our hotel. The room was on average 27 dollars a night, which is a steal for summer in Vegas. The ratings weren't too stellar but we gave it the benefit of the doubt. So we arrived and we were given a room with two beds even though we booked a room with a king sized bed.  We literally had to beg them to give us the room that we asked for. They stated that even though we paid for our room ahead of time, they booked all the rooms with a king sized bed because they are booked on a first come, first served basis. They asked us to come back the next day, stand in line and compete for the room that we booked originally. They must be trippin'!  That seemed a  little unethical to me  for the hotel to take our money but give us a room that we did not request. It made me regret booking my hotel accommodations at the Riviera!   After some probing and insisting, they upgraded our room after I kept reminding them that it's unfair to take someone's money and not give people what they ask for!   Even though that act put them sort of in our good graces, the casino overall old, run down, and pales in comparison to the other casinos on the strip!   I won't be staying there ever ever EVER again!
587	1	I live in Henderson, so this review is from a local.  I looked up what time they opened so I could be first in line for a take out for our lunch order. Looked up the distance and time so as to arrive around 15 minutes early. So I'm standing there and a bmw pulls up and sits right there in front of the entrance and of course leaves their engine on to run the a/c as it's around 100F out. The fumes started to bug me so when I saw one of the employees I knocked on the glass door and asked to sit inside (even though they weren't open yet) and he immediately let me in around 10 minutes early! One star.  I sat and people started coming in before anyone was seated, and I didn't feel like standing just to be first. When they started seating, the guy said ok, who's first (second star) and I stood, walked past the other people and said I'd like to make a take out order.  I just got two cheeseburgers and an order of fries. He asked me if I wanted L / T / O (lettuce, tomatoes, onions) and I said yes, how would you like them cooked? One well done, one medium. I forgot to tell them to burn my fries - I like them really crunchy. Oh well, next time.  The order took around 15 minutes or so (third star). The fourth and fifth star was for the first bite of my bachi burger. The bun is thin, so you don't have to unhinge your jaw to get a full bite. The burger is just tasty and juicy and I got l / t / o with every bite. Fries were good (crunchy next time!). For the fries, I'm in love with their pineapple ketchup. And they marked one well done!  Location: right off the 215, a couple cross streets down Windmill.  Total was $24 with change.
588	1	I usually don't like to eat on The Strip when I'm in Vegas, but I was tempted to check out this place. I loved the cow art all over the restaurant. Our waiter was very attentive and the service was amazing. Yes, these buglers are not cheep, and your bill will probably go up if you're drinking, but then again it's The Strip.  I had the Gold Standard, which was one of the best burgers ever. The meat was delicious and the goat cheese complimented the burger perfectly. My friend had the burger with pork rinds and oaxacan cheese, which was so good. It was my heavy at all it was actually perfect. I really wanna try their adult shakes next time I'm there. Great beer selection also. They know their beers and burgers which is an A+ for me.
589	0	This place wasn't gross, but it wasn't good. I honestly just got a ton of salad and ice cream. I'd be pissed if I spent the full price on it but my friend checked in on Foursquare so we got a buy-one-get-one voucher so it was like $30 for the two of us for dinner. I guess it was fun to try a buffet in Vegas but maybe my expectations were a little too high? I'd rather have spent twice that and had a real meal at a good restaurant.  The desserts were the best part.
590	0	I am not even sure where to start as I know this review will offend some... For that I apologize in advance.  I decided to stop for the night while driving through Vegas for a little gaming and fun. I called ahead and booked a "renovated" room which was supposed to have "European comfort mattresses", a flat screen TV, fridge, hair dryer, and so on.  Upon arriving at the Riviera after walking through filthy brass and glass doors, I waited in line for a good 20 minutes to check in. Every employee, even management were cloaked in dumpy, dirty uniforms. After getting my room key I was shuffled from the front desk through the poorly organized casino floor to find the elevator to my room, it was kind of like a scavenger hunt. Now, the elevators! Filthy, dirty floors, base boards, more brass and broken mirrors full of hand-prints; at this point I was reconsidering my stay. Up to the room which was NOT renovated in the least bit we were greeted by our maid who had JUST started cleaning! The mattress was discussing and was more like a maxi pad then a "European comfort mattress". The carpet was warn and filthy which actually went well with the general motif of the room which was dirty. Flat screen TV??? Nope. Old box TV. No amenities what so ever, not even a cheap $10 hair dryer.  Now when you go to the Riviera and sign up for their players club card you receive what was near capital punishment... The free buffet. It was as unorganized as the casino itself and the food was so disgusting I didn't stay and eat. Now there were people in there eating who did seem to be enjoying their free buffet but keep in mind they had a couple noticeable teeth missing and babies on their hips; pure white trash tornado bait. Now even these picky consumers were saying "at least it's free" in regards to the buffet. Now stop and think for a second, a pile of dog poop is free but would you eat it? The casino itself is owned by a Chinese man which would explain that a large majority of the dealers didn't speak English well enough to understand. They also never smiled, they acted like they were chained to the tables and hated their jobs. This might also explain the awful Chinese food at the buffet, angry cooks! If the white trash patrons isn't enough to make you stay somewhere else, try the countless thug-like gang banger want to be's with fake diamond earrings and gold chains.  I spoke to a Manager regarding my room situation and she had no time or sympathy for me being placed in an un-renovated room, the quality of the staff or the filthy conditions. She didn't even offer to comp the $79 room! The only thing she did was charge me the un-renovated room rate which should have been done anyway.  People go to Vegas to enjoy being pampered and taken care of, excellent customer service and attention to detail... none of which the Riviera possess. Walk into any other casino on the strip and you will see staff that great you with a smile, go out of their way to help you. The entrance to every other casino I've been to are constantly being rubbed with Brasso and the glass is spotless. Ah, if you decide to have a cocktail it is faster to leave the casino and go buy one due to the fact that the waitresses rarely come by and three times when I ordered a Diet Coke, they never even came back!  If it was possible to give the Riviera no stars, I would. Don't waste your money there... at least go somewhere where they smile when they take your money :)
591	0	We had a craving for some hooters wings and was quite dissapointed with the food and service from this location. The hostess had us waiting in line for 15-20 mins, when we pointed out 6-7 different free tables throughout the restaurant, she told us those tables didn't have a waitress, then ultimately seated us and the next few people at those same tables. Needless to say the service was slow and BAD, the food took FOREVER, we got our burgers BEFORE we got our wing appetizers, and the waitresses had no interest in their job. Management really needs to evaluate the hostess and serving staff, and offer some type of customer service training.
592	1	Came here on the hype.  Definitely a good choice for breakfast.  Portions were massive!!!! Went with the chicken and waffles. It was delicious. Fried chicken and bacon filled waffles with fried leek.  I also tried Andy's sage chicken eggs benedict. It had a nice flavor to it. Service was good too.  They were friendly and catering. I do recommend this spot.
593	0	I know the servers are supposed to be "wise crackers" but there is a difference between being witty and being a complete ass. I can handle jokes.  When we sat down our bartender, Shane, barely even gave us the time of day. I didn't feel welcomed at all. I really felt like I was bothering him, and that is a very uncomfortable feeling.  Needless to say we didn't stay for dinner. We paid for our drinks and left. And Shane if you are still looking for your tip here it is... Don't be such a complete jack ass. How's that for a tip.
594	0	The 2.5 star average seems a little generous. We went on a Saturday for late breakfast and the average age was about 22. Mostly all hungover or drunk. Loud, rude, inconsiderate, covered in tattoos, piercings and sweat from their testosterone shots. There were a couple of employees with headsets walking the room and it was hard to tell if it was to let the front desk know about open tables, or if it was security.   Food was very mediocre at best. Basic watery eggs, greasy bacon, stale looking muffins, soggy waffles. The desserts didnt even look close to anything you'd want to waste the calories on. What you'd probably find in a hometown buffet, Circus Circus or Fremont street.   It's clear MGM Resorts is only concerned with attracting the under 30 crowd now who don't really know much if anything about manners or common decency. If MGM has decayed this much, I weep for their other properties. Probably all the same swill just dropped off one at a time at different casinos each morning.
595	1	This place is pretty cool and pretty delicious.  It reminds me of some of my favorite restaurants in San Diego -- delicious twists on your everyday food (philly cheese steak spring rolls and truffle lobster mac n cheese?!?) and of course a huge beer selection.  Despite the huge temptation that the appetizer menu drew, I'd picked this place with burgers in mind and so I stuck with burgers and wasn't disappointed.  The Gold Standard Burger (beef sirloin, bacon, goat cheese, tomato confit, arugula & garlic-chive aioli) was excellent and cooked to medium perfection.  I payed a bit extra to have sweet potato fries instead of the shoestring, and though they were tasty I preferred the shoe string that I got to try off my boyfriends' plate.  The burger in addition to being a hefty portion was also flavorful in every way.  I was HUGELY satisfied.  Also tried the yummy artichoke guacamole (served with fresh made pita chips).  The atmosphere is kind of urban/trendy with fun, bright colored paintings on the walls.  The wait wasn't long on a Sunday afternoon (no one ahead of our large party, we just had to wait until the staff got a table together).  We had a hot waitress and plenty of other people walking around to bus tables and refill drinks and waters.  The whole experience was worth five stars and I can't wait to go back to Vegas and eat here again.
596	1	The food is super-rich.  You will get very full if you attempt to eat everything on your plate.  I have ordered pasta and steak and both were excellent.  I would say the pasta dishes are the way to go, as the few sauces I've ordered were very good.  I got a bite of my wife's iceberg salad and it was very good as well.  They serve Cheesecake Factory dessert, so try to save enough room.
597	0	I have been to a lot of clubs in LA but never explored the Vegas scene and since Tao is one of the places that is frequently raved about I figured I should hit it up. It was a big disappointment and I don't think I would ever go again. My friends and I got on the guestlist and even with the guest list it was an hour wait time. Luckily all of us girls are able to get in for free. There was free drinks for girls on the guest list from 10-11pm but since the waiting was so long by the we got in all the free drinks were gone. Drinks there are about $13 a piece and they were not very strong. So needless to say I think the drinks there are a complete rip off. I enjoyed the decor and the dancers but it was much too small a space for all the people they let in. The big dance room was completely filled and you literally cannot move in there. My friends and I spent most of our time in the small dance room but it was also crowded in there because it was where the reserved seating areas were. The space in the small dance room was really awkward because random sections of it were ropped off to people who reserved it. It wasn't good use of space and the music was not very good. I think I could find better nightclubs in vegas than Tao.
598	1	I went to the Peppermill for my 21st bday, and got my first drink there.  I purposefully went looking for somewhere to go for my 21st, and I loved all the photos of the outside and inside of the Peppermill. When I got there, I was not disappointed by its looks. Sure, some may think its too "vegas-y" or tacky but I really enjoyed the uniqueness.  As for the food, the portions are large but finish-able, I had a pancake breakfast for dinner and my boyfriend had the fish and chips (curly fries) and we were both happy. I tried a mai tai and it was pretty big and delicious, though I can't compare it to other mai tai's as it was my first drink.  The staff were very helpful, and we even got a free souvenir photo!   If you're going to Vegas, I'd definitely stop by at least once (or twice). Also, LARGE parking lot!
599	0	Disgusting!!!! It was gross. They were rude!! & tried to make my husband pay $25 more because we are from NY & because conservation fee for the water.  (We pointed it out & they took it off) i got terribly sick the next day! & we were on our honeymoon please I'm begging you don't go there. & the sangria is not sangria its juice has no alcohol in it!!!!
600	1	Alright, let's talk Thai;  I could eat Thai food everyday, for every meal, I literally cannot get enough of Thai food into my pie hole. And I would gladly move to Thailand in a heartbeat if it weren't the sauna sweatbox of tropical equator hell, where  I'd look like a tool that had taken a shower in my clothes pretty much whenever I walked outside....  not pretty.  So as a consolation, I've been terribly fortunate to have the best Thai restaurant in the U.S. right in my own back yard, (well, ten miles away but whatever) within the first week of moving here, I had my first experience at Lotus of Siam and my world has never been the same since.    And what a surprise that here, in this archaic mish mash of tired trashy tourist sin reeking of cheap vodka and regret, there lies a culinary palace in the most unsavory of places, but a landmark nonetheless, (and ever since it's small cameo on Top Chef, the hoards of tourists have increased tenfold, making wait times to over an hour at peak times).  In a rundown shopping center east of the Strip, Chef Saipin creates some the loveliest, humble yet sophisticated dishes that make up for the lack of ambience.  Now please, please do not be disparaged by the desolate location and crappy shopping center facade; yes, it is dilapidated and no, your car will not get jacked (many a friend have periodically checked to see if their car's still there) no worries, the homeless keep an eye out for ya!  They've even told me I had a brake light out, which deserved a buck...good people, those cracky addicts...  As you enter through what I can only imagine is akin to walking through the entryway of a Western Union in Compton, you've suddenly matrixed into a crowded, tiny vestibule that is indicative of the original size of the restaurant.  In fact it's recently gone trough an expansion, and when you've managed to squeeze past the herd, the room on the right is the expansion, while directly in front of you is the original dining room.  And the interior, although updated, has the exact the same finishes: green carpeting dark, mahogany wood chair rails, brass railings and oddly scaled glass drop chandeliers....it's like a time machine into retro...without the chic... which I have grown to absolutely love, like visiting grandma's house in the not so nice neighborhood during the Holidays.  Apart from your typical Thai Apps, (Shrimp Toast, Stuffed Chicken Wings)  The Moo Dad Deaw is an awesome starter, akin to a Bar snack item, to be eaten with a nice cold beer.  These succulent, juicy, tender pieces of pork are the precursor to chicken fingers, you can easily pop these suckers one after one in your mouth; as a good accompaniment, have some Sticky Rice to go with it; go ahead wreck your diet, you weren't serious about those New Year's resolutions anyways...  My favorite curry dish on the menu, which isn't you normal curry dish:  the Braised Short Rib with Penang Curry - this luxurious dish has all the depth and richness laid into it's protein not usually paired with Thai cuisine but definitely makes sense.  The hearty Short Rib goes so well with Penang, which is so good, Chef Saipin add Cognac into the Curry which elevates it to whole different level.  I bypass all the other curries cuz I know this one has the best flavor profile out of all of them.  Lotus of Siam has made me a Pad See Ew snob, ever since that first time I ate here, the quality and technique that is executed here is so superb; I honestly have to remind myself that it's not supposed to be this good!  First, the Noodles have that perfect texture; mochi chewiness but firm enough to achieve maximum noodle satisfaction.  Combine it with the Egg, Beef, Broccoli and sweet Soy, it's such an addictive dish that's light yet savory with just a hint of Black Pepper to tighten the palate...just yum.  Another all time favorite of mine:  Crab Fried Rice.  The way that Lotus makes this dish is pretty unbelievable, the rice is incredibly fluffy with a light infusion of crab broth.  I love finding morsels of Crab and Egg as if it's a treasure hunt and there's always a big hunk of Tomato wedge that's seems so out of scale with everything else that's on the plate.  But, as I've ordered this dish consecutively on numerous occasions, it's become a endearing and integral component that adds acidity to an otherwise aromatic, subtle dish.  It is a must-get item on the menu, but be warned, it's not an all out powerhouse of strong flavors, so you may want to order it as an earlier course before the heavier dishes arrive to your table.   As dining experiences go, it's all over the place except for the food.  And in the end, with moderate prices, I can't really say that anything else affect the fact that Lotus has the best Thai food I've ever had.    Ratings (Out of Five Stars) Food:          5+++ Ambience:  2 (much improved hole in the wall) Service:       4.75 (they're always so busy, it can't be helped)
601	0	This review based solely on their famous Frozen Hot Chocolate.  Honestly, it was just ok. It was nice on a warm summer day, but it left this wierd, Splenda-ish aftertaste in my mouth that I did not particularly care for. I didn't find anything too special about this drink. It would have been better if they had a mocha/latte flavored one since I was craving a coffee flavored iced drink for that morning. Meh.   Being not entirely impressed my first time here, I doubt I will return considering there are many other great restaurants in Vegas to try out first.
602	0	Do NOT eat here it will be a waste of your money.  My husband and I shared an omlet and he had a tea and I order a mimosa. Out bill was $45.00 food was cold, service was slow and we were al around unimpressed.  If you are looking for a great breakfast with great food amd a good deal without the long las vegas tourist wait, go to "The Original Pancake house" just 15 minutes from the strip.   Don't waste your time or money on this awful place
603	1	The hype is true, Burger Bar is the best place in Vegas for a Burger. Must have the buffalo on onion bread. Once you're done devouring your creation take a walk in order to make room for dessert. Create your own milkshake with liquor. Awesome service.
604	1	Came here for brunch this past Saturday.  My cranky pants best friend was getting really cranky cause the coffee took a bit long to get to us and the food took even longer.  Anyways, places like this likes to deliver entrees to everyone at the same time and we had a party of 11.  I got the croquette madame and he got the chicken and waffles.  My entree was delicious and their fries were perfection.  His chicken was mediocre but the waffles and maple syrup was delicious! We also got a side order of the sausage and apple wood bacon.  Both were so good.  Together the both of us, it was $70.  Not too bad. Definitely want to return to try their dinner menu.
605	0	This place is sub par. Long wait. Rude staff. They don't pay attention when you talk and don't remember what you say. They seem annoyed to be serving you. The food is average at best. Food is certainly over priced for the quality. I love the decor and the concept but this place is not worth anyone's time. Maybe if you have never been to Vegas you can come here once to check it off your list but I highly doubt you would be very enticed to come back. If you are looking for a great place to eat in Vegas, visit the Wicked Spoon. Now that place is definitely worth your time and money.
606	1	Wow, was Lotus of Siam excellent! Wonderful service, the most extensive list of German wines I've seen outside of Germany (and what could go better with Thai food than German wine?) and outstanding food, the best Thai I've ever had. The northern Thai sausage was my favorite item, followed closely by the eggplant and mushroom appetizer. Lots of complex flavors expertly developed. My thanks to Anthony Bourdain for the recommendation.
607	1	Yuuuuuum, this place is great! I came here during a weekday so there was no wait, but still a lot of patrons! So be careful if you're going to come here during the weekend. By the way, don't let the outside fool you. It's pretty big inside!  The food here is so flavorful! The service is uhhhhmazing and if you're Asian, you know it's rare you get good service at Asian restaurants. We started off with the tom yum soup, level 6 spicy. The spice level would definitely go up next time. It has just the right hint of hot and sour. Next we got the pad thai which totally blew me away. Pad thai is something I always need to get at a Thai restaurant to compare and this dish surprised me with how good it tasted. The papaya salad was good, but nothing really special. Garlic prawns were huge and crispy and I could taste the slightest hint of garlic! I hate it when food items claim they have garlic in it but you can't taste it for shit. Next we got the drunken noodles w/ soft shell crabs. MMMMMM, so gooood! Crabs was good and drunken noodles had the right amount of flavors. Last, we went with the mango sticky rice. The rice could be sweeter in my opinion but overall, not bad.  I love this place and would continue to come back when I'm in Vegas. Until then, I'll be dreaming about it.
608	1	First time eating here.  4 of us had 4 different items based off of our server, Patrick's,  recommendation.  Every item was unbelievable!  Patrick was very helpful ,courteous, and attentive to our needs.  Great experience and wonderful service!  We will be back.
609	1	We eat Thai food all over the country as we're traveling. We've been eating here for over 10 years.The food is still excellent and the service is as well. We had a bump this time. I called on Thursday for reservations on Saturday night at 6 o'clock but when we arrived there was no reservation on their books. (Still not sure if that was their mixup or mine. Make sure when you call that they take your first and last name.)   They worked us in as fast as they could, which ended up being about 20 minutes. It is difficult, sometimes, to get through to even make a reservation, but it is WORHT IT!   We had garlic prawns, crispy duck with drunken noodles, Larb from the Northern Menu and a sliced beef in coconut dish from the Chef's Choice menu - all four dishes were excellent. Don't miss the coconut ice cream on hot sticky rice.   Lotus of Siam is still a favorite.
610	1	Man I am going to die dreaming about the crispy duck with coconut curry sauce. If only I could rest on a bed of duck in a sea of coconut curry...  Ordered: -Crispy duck with coconut curry -Garlic Prawns  -Coconut Ice cream -Fried Rice -Pad Thai -Green Curry  The crispy duck is a huge filet of duck floured and deep fried then cut into slices and drenched in a creamy and spicy coconut curry sauce. The skin is still incredibly crispy and the fattiness cuts out the spiciness of the curry very well.  MUST GET.  The garlic prawns: basically tiger prawns half de-shelled so that their bodies are chilling outside of the shell but still wearing them like a cape. Then they are deep fried and tossed in garlic and white pepper. The shell was the best part! So crispy, salty, slightly spicy, and not the least bit oily. It was just endless crunchfuls of deliciousness. MUST GET. These fried shells are better than chips. Better than fried pork skins. Better than any crunchy savory combo item you can ever dream of. GET THESE. They are expensive.  The coconut ice cream was very interesting. Order it. Creamy yet refreshing, it had a flavor almost similar to taro.  Other stuff were whatever. The portions here are small. Be prepared to spend more here than at your regular Thai restaurant.  Also, we tried to get a thai ice tea to go and the waiter told us they were out of to-go cups... while standing in front of a huge unopened bag of plastic cups......
611	0	Ate here last night and I must say IT IS EXPENSIVE.  Three people costs 97.00 with tax.  We ordered 3 beers and that was an additional $14.  The food quality was ok but nothing that I would say separates MGM Grand buffet from a circus circus buffet - honestly, you are better off going down the strip to eat not sure if it's that no one is gambling and they have to raise the prices or if it's just a matter of them pricing it high because they think they can.  Staff was nice and the deserts were ok - the rest was sub par, the meat selections were minimal and the seafood selection was a joke
612	0	I've been coming to MGM many years but extremely very disappointed that they now charge for parking....really?  Ever since MGM opened parking was always free.  I guess MGM doesn't want my business any more...I suggest going to South Point at least their parking is completely free..
613	0	MUST HAVE: One of the gold fishes in the tanks because there are way to many in them for it not to be cruel!!!!   honestly if you gave this place more than 2 stars you need to get yourself down to chinatown on spring mountain and valley view and get yourself some WONTON NOODLES @ sam woo there because mannnnn are you missing out!!!!   first off i understand the inflated prices but $16.50 (yes, SIXTEEN FIFTY) for what taste like water with the essence of chicken broth and noodles (which ok are decent).   honestly this place is ridiculous!!! the design of the place is cool, but the food is what you are sitting down and paying for is not even close to being worth it, save yourself $16.50 and get a box of SHIN RAMEN.
614	0	I can't add a name to my room of one of my guests from the room itself.  Well...currently the line at the front desk is 30-45 minutes...so you're telling me I have to wait in line 30-45 minutes just to add the name of one my guests to the room? Yes, in fact that is the case.  Note to self...never book at the MGM Grand.  Supervisor was no more helpful or friendly than the staff member at the front desk.  I had a thought...do I need to go downstairs to order room service? To request a late checkout? To request a rollaway bed? Any of these things? Because that could certainly pose a security threat as well...ludicrous logic.  The supervisor I spoke to was named Yvette for the record, in case management happens to view this.  I don't want any action taken against her, as I'm sure that was protocol she is required to follow.  But really? I need to waste 45 more minutes of my night (I waited that long to check in in the first place) to add a single name to the room?  Please justify that.
615	1	I've been here since Monday and today is Wednesday FINNALLY some real good food! Chicken fried steak cooked to perfection gravy was on point and the potatoes works were seasoned and cooked just right! My husband got the egg sausage bacon and toast SOO GOOD!! Oh and the banana nut muffin!! YUM!!!   I definitely recommend this place for the perfect breakfast!
616	1	Great restaurant.We came for dinner,about 10 minutes before it opened,and there was already a long queue there.  The food is good,we ordered garlic prawns,green curry with beef,fried sea bass with sweet and sour sauce.I highly recommend the green curry,always my favorite.
617	0	What a HUGE disappointment!!! Way overpriced, horrible service and a one hour wait during lunch at 1:30pm....which they called brunch. I would have liked a salad but the options were very limited, as this was brunch, so they mainly had egg dishes and of course their desserts. So I ordered $15 Nachos. The nachos came with a 1/4 inch layer of grease on the bottom of the bowl and the cheese tasted like some kind of canned cheese wiz. The meat was so over cooked it was super crumbly. I saw the server once and I had to ask another waitress for the bill, as my waitress was busy talking to the table next to us. I will admit the  Frozen Hot Chocolate was vey good and that gave this review its one star. However, for  $11 for a size small, it too was over priced!
618	1	Now my second favorite breakfast in Las Vegas (Hash House is #1). The place doesn't look like much situated in a rundown strip mall several miles off the strip. I am thrilled we picked this place though, they have earned all their outstanding Yelp reviews. Excellent service and excellent food.
619	0	This club was boo-boooooooooo! First of all, they had us climbing 20 flights of stairs only to have us come back down to the third level [a level above the restaurant]!! It was SO packed that I was unintentionally [or maybe intentionally] groped the entire frickin' night! And the people that work for the club, the ones in suits, are douche lords. [The ones in red shirts were awesome though! lol] Never going  back to this OVER-RATED ass club!!
620	0	I gave the MGM Grand Hotel 4 stars in my review for them. Too bad their buffet wasn't on the same par. If Charles Barkley ate here, he probably would have said that the food was "turrable...absolutely turrable!" I understand that food (and just about everything else) in Vegas is overpriced, but if I'm gonna pay $20 for a lunch buffet, I would expect better. I did like the fresh fruit they had, but everything else was just...meh. I don't consider myself as someone who's hard to please, but damn, they've got to step their game up here.
621	0	I don't understand why there is always a long wait when you visit the outside food window. You literally wait a good 30-45 mins to order and 10-15 more for your food. This past sunday (Easter) it was 40-50 min wait for food alone. I hate to think how long you wait for food inside the restaurant?! I only come here for the frozen hot chocolate which is delicious. But the price is definitely not. You pay over 10 bucks for something the size of a tall drink at Starbucks. Lame-o's!
622	0	Granted that I was in Las Vegas, it was not surprising that I was hung over. My friends and I were staying at the PH Towers and the last thing I wanted to do, was to step out into the scorching 100 degree heat for some food.  We had a group of eight people, who each wanted something different and it was a huge headache, trying to figure out a place that would accommodate everyone's taste. Not to mention, I already had a huge headache from all of the previous night's alcohol consumption to begin with.   We finally agreed to give Planet Dailies a try, since they had such a vast variety on their menu. They had all sorts of dishes: soups, salads, Asian cuisine, pastas, sandwiches/burgers, breakfast, steaks, seafood, smoothies, and shakes.   I got the Hong Kong Wonton soup, which was okay. It came with leafy greens and several wontons. The broth was nice and clear, but it wasn't as good as wonton soup from an Asian restaurant of course. It was the perfect remedy for the time being. I also got the try the chicken fettuccini and the spaghetti with meatballs. The chicken fettuccini was too dry and the Alfredo sauce was way too thick. On the other hand, the spaghetti and meatballs was great. It was a humungous serving that my friend could not finish. Luckily, she was nice enough to share. The meatballs were tender and abundant. The sauce was the perfect consistency and I liked it.  The food actually deserves three stars, but I've given them an overall two stars, for their incredibly slow service. The food took a good thirty minutes to come out and when one of my friends asked for an extra spoon and Tabasco sauce, it took the waiter 15 minutes to bring out just the spoon--he had forgotten about the Tabasco sauce. There were only two other tables being occupied at the time, so the slow and forgetful service was really unacceptable.   Since they are open 24 hours, I would probably only come back during a drunken stupor, when I am feeling too good to even care about how long my food takes.
623	1	I prefer the Palazzo location over the Venetian location.  My favorite is the French Toast during brunch.  It is crispy on the outside and soft, warm, and gooey on the inside.  I have never experienced French Toast like this, but I am hooked and have been since trying it a couple of years ago.  I always order it with a mimosa, freshly sliced strawberries and bananas, and it includes the caramel syrup. OMG!!!    Yum!
624	1	i love all things french. i love bouchon. i came here for the first time last summer and ordered a million things for dinner and everything was delish. this time i came for brunch and ordered a million things such as the bread pudding french toast, an order of sausage, and the pomme frites. the atmosphere is very chic french bistro, the music is good, the pricing is reasonable and the food is awesome.
625	1	Went here a month ago and then went again this past week...this place just gets better and better!  This time we ordered the American Kobe Beef burger...the meat was so tender and juicy and it made all the difference!  We also ordered the Cobb Salad which I expected to be just OK but it was EXCELLENT!  The wait staff was also super friendly/attentive which makes the experience all the better.
626	0	I gave this hotel 2 stars but I'm not sure why. The room has a nice blind. That's probably what rises it from the one star i really think this place should get. I'm not a real fan of vegas, but I've stayed at places far nicer than this. For most meals i went across the street to New York because all there is here are either hugely overpriced places or macdonalds and nothing in between. Nothing at all if you like to, ahem, eat healthy food which doesn't seem like most people in vegas want to do I suppose.  Lousy music follows you everywhere. The cardio room was HOT - must have been 85-90 degrees in there - not good - equipment was OK but they could use a few more ellipticals. If you're into treadmill you're in luck, but only if you like to do your cardio in a sauna.  The room itself was small, noisy (bring your earplugs), housekeeping did not pay attention to do not disturb (wellness check? Have you thought of using the phone?), no fridge - just a mini bar that they have no problem telling you they will CHARGE you if you put your own stuff in there. No Coffee machine - that just makes me grumpy in the morning. Lines at check in were long, long, long, Why do people put up with this? I don't know, maybe it's just Vegas, but this place seems even worse than most. Not recommended.
627	0	$6.50 for mediocre tacos? 20 kinds of veggie fried rice $25, add chicken $5= $30(Tiny portion), 8 pieces miniscule shrimp at $29, shrimp & pork dumplings (8pcs) at $25, beers at $8?  Taste and flavor were so-so at best. Definitely not worth the price tag.
628	0	This restaurant was definitely quite pricey for the quality of food they serve. The food was mediocre at best, with the highlight being the free hot fudge sundae (we had a coupon). The food was incredibly heavy and honestly, didn't feel much better than your local Olive Garden/Cheesecake Factory. This place is kind of crowded, especially on weekends and you definitely have to make reservation at least a day ahead of time (don't know why, nothing so great here).  The service was also very odd. Our waitress changed her attitude very clearly after we decided to not order alcoholic drinks. Not only that, she was serving a table next to us and she was definitely speaking to them inappropriately about something, telling the other table that they should not be doing certain things due to the fact that she will get in trouble for it (waiters should not be saying this to customers). She also went into a long-winded story with them about how she got into trouble. She spoke incredibly loudly and even in the loud restaurant, I could hear her from when she was serving the other table near us. This definitely made us feel very uncomfortable there.  Probably won't come back again, since there's plenty of other awesome restaurants in Vegas.
629	0	The price is way too high for the food. The food is decent but you can find the same food on Spring Mountain road for 1/3 the price. I had the Shichuan Dan Dan Mein and Stir-fry Lamb with Cumin. Both were ok. The portions were on the small side. The service is zombie-like and the decor is plasticky. Not recommended.
630	0	There was a bug on my wife's nachos. It looked like an earwig or roach. It was really nasty. The waiter asked if she wanted another nachos or something else. She ordered a strawberry waffles which she really didn't want.  She was afraid if she ordered another nachos, they would just remove the bug and give her the same nachos.  Everyone had water with lemon except me. I had an iced tea with lemon. I had 6-chicken strips (nothing comes with it). My sister had the same. My kids has Mac & cheese and a kids corn dog. Very small portions for $100+.   They did however give my wife a free frozen hot chocolate dessert to make up for the earwig/roach thing. (Only reason they are getting a 1)
631	1	I heart this place!  True the wait was atrocious, but not when you just have two in your party. We waited about 20-30 minutes which gave me just enough time to surf through the yelp reviews to figure out what to order.  To start we ordered - Coffee, which was not THE BEST coffee we ever had, but strange enough we both had 3 cups nonetheless.   - Bouchon Pastry Basket, we had our server pick for us, although I was mildly disappointed he didn't give us the almond pastry I was hoping for...his selections were superb nonetheless...plus he gave us beignat, which I totally forgot about and good thing he remembered, because they only make it for weekend brunch.  So our pastry basket consisted of Pain au Chocolat, Lemon Currant Scone, Cheese Danish & Beignat.  The only pastry I thought was subpar was the Lemon Currant Scone, but the fresh jam they provided made that scone great!   For our entree we ordered .. - Croque Madame, which was toasted ham & cheese on brioche with a fried egg & mornay sauce. Served with pommes frites. This was an excellent dish, such a simple concept, but sOOo good!   - Chicken & Waffle - the most tender Rotisserie chicken paired with bacon & chive waffle... definitely not Roscoe's. Tasty tasty!  Would we return?  OH...HECK YEAH...
632	1	Awesome, especially during happy hour! Best value meats (everything $4 and under) and unlimited banchan.   We really liked the bulgogi and pork belly. It was the first time I've tried chicken cheese fondue and that was great too.   Would definitely come here again. It's off the strip but right next to the Hard Rock and such great value.
633	1	I went on a Saturday afternoon at the perfect time. I walked in and there was no line!! Nice service and very tasty and amazing pizza!!   I ordered two pizzas: white and pepperoni and my other half ordered a cheese and sausage pizza. We were give. A mushroom instead of a cheese, but the cashier was nice enough to let me keep the mushroom and still give me a slice of cheese pizza for free. I rarely ever eat three slices of pizza in one sitting, but it was so delicious, I couldn't help but finish all three!   The White pizza was definitely my favorite! Put some garlic powder on it and it tastes even better! Two thumbs up!
634	0	Apparently desperate times call for desperate measures.   I stayed here last year for the Singapore Math convention and swore blind never again to patronize this hotel... I hate it when I find myself having to eat my words...  This year, I'm attending the same conference with a friend who, after four rounds of chemotherapy has difficulty walking and in need of frequent naps. With such limited options, I reluctantly re-booked the hotel.  The staff were lackluster last year and this time, again, they didn't disappoint.   They made it clear that they would not provide any special services in spite of my friend's afflicted state. I could get a coffee-maker for my sparsely furnished (but clean) room - but that would cost me $40 for our three nights.  I wished I could say we made up for it with cheap room rates... we didn't... our pitiful room cost $99 a night - special conference rates, apparently. A horrific rip-off, even by Las Vegas standards, especially considering we have to walk through 110 deg temperatures in the outdoors to get to the restaurants.  Next year, we're putting the room rental money towards taxi fares from the Bellagio.  Boooooooo.
635	1	So glad we can go get our Shake Shack fix without having to fly clear across the country and we can hop on a plane and fly an hour to get to it. It's just simply magnificent! I love burgers and I just love shake shacks' burgers. I even love their fries. Not sure what they are called but they are delish, especially with them covered in cheese!  Oh man...just thinking about it I want to go get one right now....yummmmmm
636	1	There are no words for how unbelievable this place was. The service was AMAZING and and in addition to that, the food was all that I was hoping for and then some!!!  The burger was perfectly cooked to order-I ordered medium and actually got my burger, or should I say BurGR, medium! I got the farm burger and the server described the duck bacon exactly how it tasted and the egg was perfectly over easy.   The fries, which all five of us ordered our own order of fries, were super delicious!  When we ordered drinks, the server let me taste the various beers and wines that I was interested before finally settling on my final drink.   The wait was absolutely worth it and EVERYONE who goes to Vegas and likes burgers should stop by!  Thanks Gordon Ramsy for his materpiece!
637	0	Food is just ok especially since they are SUPER expensive for such a small portion of food that isn't really that good. I gave them a try twice because I give everyone a mulligan just in case they have a bad day...but unfortunately, there was no change. :( They have a cool concept...but way too expensive for what you DON'T get....which is a full tummy with yummy food. You are better off trying some where else.
638	1	My wife and I wanted to have our anniversary dinner at GR Steak and let me tell you... it was fantastic! We were brought in on schedule at 6:30. We were given some interesting details about decor as we were taken to our table. Unfortunately the table was in a dark corner on the first floor with a wall for my view. I politely asked if we could get another table and our request was granted without hesitation... a table at the bottom of the stairs with a perfect view of the action. Our waiter Alex was excellent... answering every question we had and not making us feel rushed. We ordered wine and the chorizo stuffed lobster tail for an app and it was outstanding! Next we ordered our entrees... the rib cap for me and the infamous beef wellington for my wife. The rib cap was amazing as well as the wellington... melts in your mouth. My wife and I got the asparagus and mac and cheese for sides respectively... and let me tell you it was the best mac and cheese Ive ever had! Then it gets better... dessert is sticky toffee pudding... omg... I have never tasted any dessert that can even come close to the synergy of flavors that Chef Ramsay gave me. All I can say is Chef Ramsay delivers on all levels... from the food... to the service... to the atmosphere... this is an experience that you will never forget!... ever!
639	0	Within 60 minutes of eating at the Aria Buffet two members of our dinning party came down with food poisoning. we ate dinner at 6:00 PM and had only had plain bagels for breakfast that morning. Both members of our party were ill for the remainder of the trip and stayed in their hotel rooms. When we called early  the next morning to ask if others had become ill we were told nobody had called and they served over 2,000 people and there was no way we became ill from eating there. We don't know if others called after we did. But seemed odd that the "manager" could be sure that we did not get sick from eating there. He told me to call security and file a report. I asked him what good that would do my wife and he said he did not know but that was what we needed to do. No apology, no empathy. Keep in mind we paid $75 (per couple) for this meal and one would expect better than this.  As a result we will never set foot in another MGM property again. The situation was handled poorly.
640	1	Literally the best burger I have ever had and I have tried a lot. The restaurant is beautiful with streaming flames that dress the windows.  You could sit at a regular table or at s high seat table. To top is off they also have the best sweet potatoe fires.  To add a sweet zing they sprinkle them with powdered sugar. From now on whenever in Vegas a stop at Gordons Burgr is mandatory !!!
641	0	Booked a stay for two nights here and I am checking out tomorrow but I was no where near impressed. Payed twice what I should have for half of the experience. Room was nicely located with a great view of the High Roller and LINQ hotels but that did not make up for the poor quality of the room. First of all, my room was not ready for check in until three hours after planned, and I found this out after waiting in a very long registration line. Secondly, the room was not dirty, but could have been taken care of a little more. It was nice having a big TV to fall asleep with but the furniture was very minimal with no refrigerator. Housekeeping did not show, and the door to all of the rooms on our floor have no stopper, so they constantly slam all night and day. Overall, I would say that this stay was not quite what I expected.
642	1	Hot, cheesy yumminess. Yes, please! For $5/slice this is a great way to get away from all the buffets and fine dining and just kick back. My favorites were the mushroom and cheese. There's also a nice lounge area to shoot pool and kick it outside the hallway. Chill out to the max.   It's also very close to the Eastside Tower elevators, so take a ride to the 3rd floor and enjoy a late night snack.
643	0	I will NEVER go back. My brother took me once and we had a great experience. My husband and I purchased the groupon deal for the last time and wow it was awful. We sat in the crowded room with oyr table about a foot away from the next table, so there was no privacy. We sat THERE FOR 15 MINUTES until I asked one of the many people walking back and forth if we could get some service.  The couple sitting next to us got so upset they left. We had already paid so we decided to stay. The drinks were EXTREMELY sour, like it was the bartenders first day. The mashed potatoes had no flavor and all the meat was cold, chewy and flavorless. Worst money ever spent on a restaurant. Pick fogo de chao or texas de brazil instead.
644	0	I was totally intrigued the first time I heard of frozen hot chocolate. How can it be frozen and hot?! Well.. after trying it out first hand, I conclude that it was a total waste of my $12 (for just a to go cup size)! It was simply a thick powdery super sweet cold chocolate drink! I rather have a glass of chocolate milk ):  I later found out that this other place called sugar factory also has frozen hot chocolate on their menu- for just $6-7. If any of my friends insist on trying it in the future, I would take them to this place instead. I wonder what big of a diff it will be.
645	0	Stumbled in around midnight (because we were tired yet starving!) and ordered the angus burger and the portobello mushroom burger.  The good: fries. Maybe it was all that sodium we craved since losing it all sweating in that 108 degree heat all day, but those things were tasty!  The not-so-good: the rest of it. The angus burger looked pretty delicious, but was pretty flavorless. For some starving, tired and probably irritable dude and his girlfriend, it did not come through at all. The portobello burger was better, but still sort of blah.  We left full, however, so 2 stars!
646	1	First time trying Korean bbq and it was really good. A little pricey, but you get a lot of food. We had a group of 6 and were fine with a meat lover combo for 2 ($55.95) and a couple other sides. The wait staff was very attentive and patient considering we took awhile to figure out what we wanted.
647	1	Came here on Monday, and 1$ shots and 1$ beer! How can you say no?! What a great place to pre-game before hitting up Marquee nightclub. And must I say their burgers are out of this world! My friend and I got the kobe beef burger and the steakhouse burger and split them. Just some excellent quality meat... The taste was great too, but it mostly comes from their meat quality, so my hat off to Holsteins. Oh, and let's not forget their crunchy shoe string fries! Yummm... Okay I'm starting to sound like a fatty so I will end it here... Next time I come, I will try the shakes!
648	0	Good food. Horrible service. Hostesses never once gave us a smile or seemed happy to have us. Server took almost ten minutes to greet us. Drinks took another ten minutes. Table sat down next to us and got up and left because the server never came and greeted them! As we were eating, someone from a table behind us threw up right next to our table. This was at dinner! There was no monitoring of people's alcohol intake and honestly, I lost my appetite after someone vomiting right next to my nachos. Overpriced, especially for the service. I live here in Vegas and was taking some friends out from out of town. Definitely will not be returning. I got a water refill once, and we waited for our checks with empty plates for 20 minutes. Stay away from this place! So many better options.
649	1	Delicious, great service, and a sweet environment! Vacation perfect. Enjoyed the time with my friends. The waiters were very attentive, filling out water often and checking on us and the grill. This place is family friendly but could be great for a date night because of the quite low key environment. Food came out quickly and tasted great! Check this great place out next time you're in Las Vegas.
650	0	First of all, I and most of the people reviewing this place wrote this review to receive a free dessert for mentioning my server's name - Jorge. The food here is really not worth the price. The meat is hardly seasoned and the selection is terrible. One of their "12 cuts of meat" offered is pineapple. You would be better off just going to Texas de Brazil for better food for a better price. Also don't waste your money on all you can eat shrimp, it was served room temp with shell on and like most of the stuff here tasted like nothing.   Final note ; the free dessert looked nothing like the other desserts they had around the place, it ended up being a dry brownie with some chocolate icing on top.
651	0	I think that I didn't have the experience I should have had - if I were in NYC. I've never been to S3 in NYC but I imagine that its less Disneyland-ish with long lines and expensive drinks that taste bad.   Next time I'm in NYC I'll try the real deal.
652	0	If you are coming to Vegas as a tourist...please please please do not go to Tao.  You are wasting your time and money.  The food is worse than PF Chang's and probably borderlines with Panda Express.  If you eat dinner in the restaurant they still make you leave the property and re-enter to go into the nightclub and pay full cover.  Once inside the club, it's just horrible music and bouncer telling you that you can't stand or walk anywhere.  It's disgustingly crowded and the staff treats you like crap.  So many better restaurants and nightclub on the strip to choose from.  This place is just living off their name...
653	0	Pretty basic/average. Decided to hit at least one buffet before heading back home and this was the most convenient.  There were electronic pay machines, but you still need to wait in line. Not sure what the purpose of this really was since you still need to bypass the cashier anyways. Took us 30 mins to get thru the line.   It was still breakfast time, but as soon as we sat, they began serving lunch items. COOL!!!  Service was great and plates were picked up timely. There was a variety of foods items avail and I ended up getting three plates. One with breakfast items, meat items, and desserts (fruits, tarts and chocolate).  Omelet station was great, but a bit slow. There was a long line, but the guy was awesome and very friendly.   Overall, ehhhh buffet... It was convenient... $40 with tip...
654	1	Egg & I is a super-cute local breakfast joint away from the strip. It gets SO crowded and busy on the strip for breakfast/brunch whenever I've visited, and it makes people even hungrier and grumpier while waiting. My advice? Take a cab or drive over to this place for a REALLY tasty meal.  My group and I of five people waited about 10 minutes for a table. Once seated, we were serviced immediately. Food only took about 10 minutes to be ready, and the staff were very attentive and worked together to address our table's needs. They have a little egg sign that you can flip to the sad-face yellow side, which indicates that you're in need of something. We did this a couple times to test it out, and it worked! Lightning fast.  Great food, great service. I recommend the Biscuits and Gravy! The Ranch Potatoes (their regular side of potatoes) are very flavorful and filling. A must have. Oh, and their Banana Nut Muffin was soooo sweet and moist!  I just may be back when I'm in town. If I can get outta bed next time after a long night, that is. Tehe.
655	1	I'll admit it.  I'm a Gordon Ramsay groupie.  I DVR all of his shows from Master Chef to Hell's Kitchen to Kitchen Nightmare's.  And once or twice in my life, I've been lucky enough to eat at one of his many restaurants.  This past weekend, my friends and I were in Sin City for a birthday celebration and we decided to try the newly opened BurGR.  I'm not even slightly exaggerating when I say that the Farmhouse Burger that I ate at Gordon's new restaurant is the best burger I've ever eaten in my life.  Perfectly seasoned beef topped with Duck Bacon (which I didn't even know existed), French Cheddar, and a gooey fried egg....it was like eating a piece of art.  In addition to the burger, my friends and I shared some truffle parmesan french fries with BurGR's homemade truffle aioli and ketchup sauces (both amazing).  We also ordered creme brulee oreo milkshakes (best milkshake I've ever had).  The only dish that we ordered that I was less than ecstatic about was the honeypig bao buns appetizer...but honestly, the rest of the meal was so amazing, we completely forgot about it.  At a fairly reasonable price for Ramsay level quality food, I highly recommend trying out BurGR next time you're at the Planet Hollywood Casino in Las Vegas.
656	1	o-m-g! When it is 2am and you are starving, this place is GOLDEN! The cheese oozing burger was to-die-for! The shakes were ahhhMaZING! It is so great to have a decent meal in vegas that will not cost you an arm and a leg and is good! I would highly recommend this place! Head over towards NYNY to find this amazing burger joint!
657	1	YES. YES. YES.  I love everything about Holstein's.  Their food is SO GOOD - get the Asian pork belly - OMG.  The milkshakes look amazing but I haven't tried them yet as I'm usually hitting up Marquee later that night and need to save some room for liquor.    Ambiance is great.  The decor is hilarious and cool at the same time - like butcher shop meets harajuku lovers?  And they have a great DJ that plays after 10 (love that they're open super late!)  I will continue to come here every time I'm in Vegas, and you probably should too.
658	1	Open 24 hours a day, gigantic portion sizes, and a relaxed atmosphere...Grand Lux Cafe was the perfect late-night place to go after dancing!  Since we were staying at the Venetian, we stumbled upon this place all three nights we were there and it never let us down.  We were seated right away, the waitstaff was very attentive, and the place always had a pretty good crowd no matter what the time.    The menu is huge (and again, seriously, the portions are too), but we managed to navigate some delicious food...calamari, pizza, and potato spring rolls were among some of our favorites!  This place is a must for anyone looking for a late-night snack.  I'll definitely be back...
659	1	This morning I brought my mother and daughter in for breakfast. We had Oscar as our server. Oscar had a great attitude from the second he came over to our table. He was very attentive and friendly the whole time we were there. Food was awesome as always, just wanted to make sure Oscar was recognized for his great service.
660	1	When I first heard that my cousin insisted on dining at this staple in Las Vegas, I had visions in my head of a fancy place with modern lighting and wood tables and such. You know, the stuff that celebrity chefs do when they go to Las Vegas, which is an underrated food city. Imagine my surprise when we're driving to the restaurant and it's off the Strip. Not only that, but the restaurant is in this little strip mall. No bells and whistles or anything from the outside.  But when we get inside (and a reservation really helps because otherwise, you're waiting hours on end for a table), it was such a different story. Ten guys and we order a bunch of food. Now, I'm not a fan of Thai food but I think I'm getting more adventurous with trying food. I heard just endless raves about this place and I had hoped it was warranted. After that meal? It was warranted. I tried pretty much everything we ordered. Not one dish was a weak link. I loved, loved, LOVED both the beef tamarind and the butterfly shrimp. The beef was cooked really to perfection. No blood, grilled right without a slightly burnt taste. The shrimp was crispy and so tasty. Great food, very little noise so you could talk to people at the table, servers who let you eat in peace.  Great place. Every Thai place I go to anywhere from now on will just be second rate in comparison. That's the sign of a worthy restaurant.
661	1	My FAVORITE Grand Lux Cafe is the one inside Palazzo.  It's open LATE and the food is amazingly good for a casual chain restaurant.  Some of my favorites:  spicy calamari salad, shrimp scampi, miso glazed salmon, and caramel chicken.  Desserts are great too - can't go wrong with a batch of freshly baked chocolate chip cookies or the beignets with 3 sauces.  It's definitely worth the money.
662	0	This was my third time staying at the LVH. With my company,I travel to numerous trade shows, many of which are held in Las Vegas. This hotel is very dated but always seemed to be the best option for location and proximity to the convention center. Well, this particular trip turned ugly when on the second morning of my stay I woke up, went to the restroom and when I returned to bed, there were bed bugs crawling on the pillow. I had never seen one before but a quick search on my phone confirmed their identity. I called house keeping right away and they sent up a security guard that collected the bugs in little baggies. They sent up a bell hop to carry my things to my new room in the old unrenovated tower (downgrade). The security guard said you need to wash those clothes as soon as possible in hot water. I happened to agree. I had one more night to stay at the LVH and I in NO WAY wanted to transport those nasty creatures back to my home in FL. When I got to my new room and I made a call to find out about laundry services. I was passed around to about 4 different people before someone was able to tell me if my clothes could be laundered. House keeping passed me to the Bell hop, bell hop passed me to housekeeping. To make a long story short. It was the epitome of unorganized. Aside from the security guard saying one time, "Sorry for the inconvenience". That was the only time I was apologized to. I realize accidents happen and those bugs are a problem that hotels sometimes run into but I was shocked at how management did barely the minimum. A simple call from the manager with an apology would have gone a long way. But instead no apology as well as no compensation for my troubles, not only was a charged the full amount of the room and resort fees....I was also charged for one of the keurig coffee kits (I don't even drink coffee). This hotel was a huge disappointment, I will not be staying here again. Even though it is the most convenient to the convention center, I don't think poor customer service like I experienced, should be rewarded. Unfortunately, because of the trade shows and proximity to the center, I think they get much more business than they deserve. They have given up on customer service because of guaranteed business they get from the trade shows.
663	1	One of the best meals I've had in a while.  Visiting Vegas, I HAD to have a fancy meal from one of these amazing chefs and picked Bouchon because the prices were still reasonable.  we sat outside for dinner, in a perfect setting by The Venetian pool.  started with the "Beignets de brandade de morue" (cod fritters), was amazing. The Gnocchi a la Parisienne were out of this world, and my friends were not disappointed either. The Andouille was great, and the trout a little less magic, but still good.
664	1	I would just like to say that I love Costco pizza. I mean, its thin YET it has a nice crust. I don't like dough-y pizza? Not sure if you guys catch my drift. Any who - found this place on yelp and since I am a 'new york style pizza lover' I decided to go try it. It was a bit of a struggle finding this place but thanks to you Yelpers, I searched for the pool table & the hallway LOL.  This place is amazing. I mustve went at a good time because there were no lines. The pizza is so good. I dreamt about it last night. Definitely coming back here next time I'm in Vegas. I got a slice of pepperoni & a slice of cheese. I believe its about $5 a slice.   I wish they had a soda fountain so we could re-fill our drinks but oh well.
665	1	Absolutely incredible! Food and service was on point! The single slices are huge and a great price. The owner is laid back and very friendly it was an awesome atmosphere and even better food. The crust was crunchy and the sauce was a tad bit sweet, will be back every time I'm in Vegas.   The place in on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan hotel down an unmarked hall that's lined with record covers.  Go getchu some.
666	0	My friend and I spent all weekend excited about going to the famous Serendipity before we left Vegas. We waited close to an hour and sat on on a table that had been open the entire time we were waiting and asked them 30 minutes before if we could just sit on that table. The staff were very unfriendly and slow and the food was not worth the wait. I hope the one in NY lives up to the name because Vegas does not.
667	1	My friend recommended coming to this place, and I'm so glad I did! Probably the best Thai food I have ever had. This place is huge, and I can see why! The place immediately became packed as soon as it opened. We had Thai tea, the catfish Po Tek (?) soup, Shrimp Pad Thai, and the famous Garlic Chili Prawns. The Prawns were like $30? But soooo worth it. They were huge and full of flavor! Too bad I'm from Houston; I miss this place already.
668	0	I came to this Buffett years ago, sometime in 2007 to 2009?  Oh it was great, the food was colorful and tasted great.  There wasn't much service back then as it is now but the food now is deplorable.  This is now a local's choice type of buffet rather than something you would want to eat as a tourist:  you are expecting high grade food when you visit.  Don't come here unless you're expecting just a morning pick me up from a lousy hangover.  Don't expect service either, although you are waving your hand, it will take them some time to stop talking and playing with the coffee spouts to come over and give you a new napkin.
669	0	Ambience was nice, food and service not so much.   I ordered the "live well" omelet. The egg whites were fluffy but the lobster was nearly non existent. Every time I thought I saw a piece, it turned out to be a tomato. Asparagus was plentiful.   The "fruit" it comes with is cantaloupe only, even tho their description of mixed fruit includes berries and seasonal fruit. Cantaloupe is literally the only fruit I don't like (I'm not a picky eater). When asked if I can get a different fruit the answer was honeydew or cantaloupe ONLY. Then it should say it's served with melon, not fruit. The waiter was also not accommodating when my husband asked for onions on his hash browns, saying they already come with onions. We didn't see any.   On the upside we had a beautiful view of the gardens and the coffee was good. A better server could've changed our experience.
670	0	Cold, horrible and small selection, staff are a bunch of grumps. $17.29 for lunch. Waste of a meal with so many wonderful options. Even the cooks are downers.  Staff hung out by our booth and ran their yaps about problems with work.  Much like the pyramids, should seal this dead space up too.  What happened?!  I gave this place five stars only four months ago!
671	1	When my boyfriend told me he wanted to eat a $60 burger, I thought he had lost his mind. Who would pay that much for a burger? Well, after having it, we would, that's who.   This burger is decadent. So decadent, that I would suggest splitting it. We sat at the bar. Ordered a beer on tap, ordered a side of fries and the $60 burger split.   The place was casual, fun and we genuinely had a good time eating that burger and hanging out at this restaurant.   If your in LV, then your probably thinking your going to spend some money anyway. If you like meat, and your not opposed to spending your money on a really expensive burger, I say this is a must try.   Enjoy!
672	1	Best Thai place I've ever been, and I've been to quite a few. Gets crowded on weekends and evenings, but they do take reservations. Not cheap and not huge portions, but taste and quality are outstanding. Great wine menu as well. Papaya Salad, Garlic Prawns (shells fried crispy like chips) and Short Rib Penang are our favorites.
673	1	Really good burgers. Choose your high quality meat, choose your bun, choose your toppings...add some foie gras.  Wha?  Well if you're into that.  This place has just about everything you could ever want on a burger and gives Hubert Keller the shoe up on the rest of the world famous chefs with restaurants in Mandalay Bay.  His Fleur restaurant is also fantastic.
674	0	We stayed at the Hilton Las Vegas in the past, but DON"T confuse the LVH with the HILTON! This is no longer the HILTON!! I didn't realize this when I made my reservation on Expedia (my mistake). This place is smoky and run down. The first room we were given had broken curtains that would not close. I called the front desk and we were sent to another room several floors down from where we were. This room was clean, but the ceiling had a huge water stain. The carpet also had stains. We kept the Do Not Disturb sign in our door. We didn't trust anyone going in our room. The safe was $13 a day to use!!! What??? That's ridiculous!! We went to the diner cafe place and it is way overpriced!!!! My husband and I split a $11 bacon and cheese omelet...blah! What happened to the cheap Vegas prices?? Not at this place! We also tried the Vince Neil restaurant (see review..NOT recommended!)  Most of the staff working this hotel and casino had no personality or seemed rude!! I ordered a drink at the bar and I was playing video poker. I noticed a bill in front of me, so I asked the bartender if my drink was comped for playing. He picked up the bill and said, "don't you see? what does this say?" RUDE!! The only reason I am giving this place a 2 star is for my winnings of $600, but we do not recommend staying here!
675	1	The experience at Gordon Ramsay Steak was amazing! We had a 6pm reservation and were seated right away. Matthew (our waiter) was extremely knowledgeable of the entire menu and went out of the way to ensure our experience was unforgettable. The service was the best we've had in Vegas!! The Wellington did not disappoint and the mac & cheese was amazing!! The wine, food, and service were superb! Matthew and all the staff at Gordon Ramsay Steak get 5 stars!!
676	0	First time here in 5 years or so, came for my 71th birthday, from Banning.  Long way to go for so much dissapointment.  I've been coming here since the mid sixties as distance, work  and time would allow.  Glory years of living in Hollywood found me there quite a bit.  Today I tasted the new hot dog, did not like it, different spicing and poorer quality than they used to serve.  Had chili dogs and fries around noon, now 7 pm and am still dehydrated as hell.  MSG in the fries, dog itself??? What gives?    Used to be a destination trip of 200 miles round trip, not any more.  Sorry Pink's, but you are not what you used to be.  Wondered why the line was shorter, now I knowi.
677	0	This place is in DESPERATE need of a major makeover. No extra blankets or pillows in the room. The bathroom 'looks' clean but with all the years of grime built up seems dirty. I won't take a bath in the tub because it needs a major scrubbing or to be replaced. Even the shower curtains are dated.  Only enough shampoo for one wash and NO bar soap.  Lamp shades have holes in them. TV is dated, even the programming is from the 80's and 90's.  Hallways are pretty quiet in the evening.  Room service is another area that's needs a major improvement. I ordered one pancake one egg and two milks for $23.80. It was brought to me in a bag in two 'to go' containers. No salt, pepper, or any other condiments, and food was ice cold by the time I got it which was less than 30 minutes from ordering. The room also lacks a table to eat a meal at while looking at the view of the roof.  The guy who brought it up was sketchy and almost wouldn't bring it in the room.  If I wasn't here on business and someone else paying for the room, I would move to another hotel.  All in all this place is a dump.
678	0	Dang what a bummer this was. My friend recommended this place to me because I was craving noodle soup. Asked the server for their best dishes and he recommended a beef noodle soup & a tom yum noodle soup. Both broths were so bland! I would've been disappointed in the flavor even if it was an instant noodle soup.  it was just salt in the wound that they were each 15$ - not terrible but definitely not a deal. At least the food looked pretty. I also got some Shanghai dumplings dim sum. 7-8 dollars for 1 order which includes 3 dumplings. Those were pretty delicious! The service was fast and the servers were friendly.
679	1	AMAZING.  Period.  The food was excellent, the service EXCEPTIONAL.  Never have we been treated so well, and given such attention.  The wait staff was amazing, and went above and beyond.  My wife and I joked that they must have mistaken us for someone else.  Our waiter, Ted, was the best we could have asked for, and my wife even hugged him as we left!lol   I was so happy, I even felt compelled to add to the already large tip.  Seeing Gordon Ramsey there himSELF ( Yes, it happened! ), was an added bonus (though we overstayed our welcome playing paparazzi ) !!!   It was an experience we will never forget.
680	1	I grew up in Montana. I know a good burger when I sink my teeth into it. Imagine my surprise when the best burger I've ever had the opportunity to experience (at a restaurant,) came from Vegas.  The kobe beef burger is worth every penny. The service is great, Sin City beer is good. There can be a bit of a wait, depending on when you get there, but it's worth it.  Doesn't quite compare to the fresh burgers my dad used to make, but it comes damn close.  If you love burgers, you have to check out the Burger Bar.
681	0	if i can give 0 stars i would .I came to vegas to have a great time and gamble for my first time and figured hooters would be a good choice, however i was wrong! I have already been to multiple casinos to gamble for my first time and have had a great experience so far but when i went to hooters it ruined my night.First i started playing slots then decided to cash out but the machine had problems so i had to wait 15 minutes until finally i found a technician that helped me with my problem. Then i headed to the card tables to try out some blackjack and was doing pretty good when i noticed a cocktail waitress and asked her for a drink because she was helping everyone else except me . she then asked me for my id with a stuck up attitude and said she would be back soon.20 minutes go by and still nothing, so i switched to a a different table with a different waitress. As i sat down to start playing a cocktail waitress wasn't paying attention and bumped right into me and spilled 2 beers all over my pants and then laughed and felt kind of stupid so i brushed it off and helped her pick up her mess. As i finish  helping her i asked her for a beer and she told me to take seat and play a hand and she would be right back. so she waits to confirm that I'm playing a hand and then sneaks over to her manager to give a description of how i looked and said i was to drunk and says to not give me anymore drinks (which was overheard by multiple witnesses).I then wait about 20 minutes and she's nowhere to be found..I was then approached and told by an eyewitness what was said after i left the table .I immediatley approached the manager that the waitress spoke to and i was told to go speak to the bar manager .As i go over to the bar manager i see the waitress and overhear her telling another waitress that some drunk guy came and knocked all of her drinks over as i walk up to her.I immediately become pissed the **** off and ask her for her name and her manger .She then brings me to the bar manager and he asks whats going on with a annoyed look on his face , i proceed to tell him whats going on and he cuts me off and rudely says "what kind of outcome do you want from this" , as the waitress walks by and says "you can even ask everyone at the table what happened" with a smirk on her face. I then ask for his manager and he brings me to the head night manager at the customer service booth.I then proceed to tell her what has happened, he then comes back from a 30 second walk and says to his manager that everyone at the table confirmed what she has said, (as i look at the table none of the players that i played with were there!!!!!).His manager then said that theres nothing she can do about it and the bar manger then said that maybe i should get a lawyer with a laugh and walks off!I immediately left there casino and will never return.not only that but i will be contacting a lawyer tomorrow morning to pursue the slanderous comments that were said by julian with a civil lawsuit . As you can tell I'm obviously not drunk but pissed the **** off and encourage everyone to go to any other casino except this one!
682	1	We went here in our September 2012 trip. We had a reservation ( you likely will not get in without one) and still had to wait about 20 minutes for our table.  Not a big deal. We both got strong drinks, very well prepared.  The bread assortment was very  nice.  I had the Beef Wellington.  OMG, I am still dreaming of this dish!  It was perfect to the last bite.  My husband had the short ribs and he said they were very good as well. We wanted to try a dessert but didn't have room.  But we will next time we go in May. Don't pass this place by, you will regret it.
683	1	This is probably one of the best breakfasts out I've had in recent times. Everything's was good and fresh. One of the best things was the banana bread/muffin. I had the pumpkin pancakes (which are not on the menu, so ask) which were so delicious that I didn't even need syrup.   My wife, who I love so much (just in case she reads this), is a finicky eater, and she wanted to come back the next day before we left (which we did). She got the skillet breakfast both times. Word to the wise, get a half order if you're not a big eater.  One last thing, went with friends so I tried the biscuit and gravy, stuffed french toast and two different skillet breakfasts. I would have been happy with any of these other orders.   Ok, I lied, this is the last thing, try the Habla Diablo verde on your food, it is very tasty. So much so, we bought a bottle to take with us.
684	0	The food took forever to arrive.  The steak/lobster tail combo was OK. I liked the steak more than than the lobster tail.  The chinese chicken salad is tasty, but the wontons get soggy fast.  The ahi tuna salad is good, but perhaps not really worth it.  Overall, nothing is amazing. I don't really like the atmosphere, because it reminds me of a cleaner Denny's or comparable diner. The food is not really worth it and there are just better options on The Strip. You must get the 50% off meal ticket in order for this place to not be severely overpriced.
685	1	Another success for Thomas Keller.  Located on the quieter back side of the Venetian, this large French restaurant is great for lunch or dinner, but the best for Sunday brunch.  It gets busy quick so either come early or be prepared to wait.   There is fresh seafood that greets you behind the host's platform.  I suggest a dozen oysters and a spicy bloody mary to get things started.  Almost everything on the menu is delicious, and they always have a few specials including an omlette/egg dish.  If you have room at the end, have some french press coffee and the beignets.  This is my recipe for happiness.  Oh yeah, finish by waddling back to your room, having some afternoon nookie (optional), and then taking a fat ass nap.  Life is good.
686	1	We went to Burgr for dinner on a Sunday evening.  There was 20 minute wait to be seated. It seems to be popular.  As a vegetarian I was not keep on a burger joint and the menu has only 1 burger for vegetarians, the Earth Burger ( portabello mushroom burger ). I am not a fan of portabello mushroom, the kitchen obliged me with a grilled cheese with veggies and their mango chutney.  It was fantastic. I would recommend that again. The staff was courteous and accomodating and so was the kitchen staff. Do give it a try, even if you are vegetarian.
687	1	I'm pretty sure Shake Shack of all places doesn't need my review, but I am going to do it anyways!  In lieu of waiting in the insane lines for the Hollywood location, I waited patiently to have my first bite of shake Shack during our Las Vegas vacation.  I'm glad I did because, being on the strip and surrounded by hundreds of other dining destinations, we didn't have to wait in a crazy line.   I chose the Double Shack Burger and cheese fries for my first Shack experience and I believe I chose right!  The burger was cooked perfectly and the flavors were really good.  I will say that the burger had a striking flavor resemblance to Wendy's though.  I'm not sure how to feel about that, but at the same time, I love Wendy's too!  With that said, fast food can never compare to the quality of burger that Shake Shack produced.  I still don't think I will battle the lines in Hollywood to get another burger, but it is my hope that they expand closer to my town so I can enjoy their food more often, without having to make a trip out of it.
688	1	my friend took me here for dinner touting it as the best bistro in vegas.  and Bouchon didn't disappoint.   wow.  the oyster/mussles/lobster platter was fantastic (just get the half platter as an appetizer, the full would be pushing it).  the duck was INCREDIBLE.  As was my friend's lamb.  We came back the next night for the steak.
689	0	Empty dining room at 7:30 pm?  Should've know it would suck.  If I'm paying $20 bucks for below-mediocre tex mex could I have a glass instead of a frat party plastic cup?  I'm trying to think of something that I liked about this place besides my company and I can only come up with "well, at least I didn't get food poisoning".
690	1	I don't know how I've lived in Vegas for so long and haven't gone to Bouchon because I've been really missing out on great food and exceptional service. It was a bit hard to find and didn't realize that you could get to the elevators from the garage area instead of walking all around in circles.   My boyfriend and I got there on a Sunday a little after noon and it was very busy but we didn't mind the wait because we were able to explore the pool area and enjoy the beautiful cool weather. After reading some of the specials of the day I had already decided on getting the a Rock Shrimp Hash before we were even seated.   We received a text message that our table was ready and we were promptly seated. Very shortly our waiter Matt came over to get our drink orders. I wasn't sure which champagne cocktail I wanted and he suggested Strawberry Fields. I was extremely happy with this suggestion because I didn't want the typical Mimosa or Bellini and it was not overly sweet but the perfect amount of strawberry flavor.  We then placed out food orders, but unfortunately they had run out of the rock Shrimp Hash that Matt said was deeeelicious (our fault for getting there so late).  I decided to order the Moules au Safran et  la Moutarde, which are mussels steamed in white wine, mustard, saffron and served with fries (or as they call it pommes frites). The boyfriend got the Chicken and Waffles which was another dish recommended by our server. Both dishes were amazing! I could not stop reaching over and stealing bites out of his Chicken and Waffles! Definitely a fan of Bouchon, not only because of the delicious food, but also the phenomenal service!
691	1	My friends and I ate here before heading out to Tao Nightclub. We got to Grand Lux Cafe around 9:30PM and were seated within 5-10 minutes. The decision to eat here turned out to be a really great since portions were perfect for the price.  My sister and I shared the Pasta Telephono and it turned out be enough to fill the both of us up. The chicken to pasta ratio was good and I loved the creamy sauce. $14.95 for two people? Good deal to me!   Reading reviews that Grand Lux is the sister company of Cheesecake Factory had me mentally comparing the two. I personally like Cheesecake Factory and found Grand Lux to be great in comparison. I'd highly recommend this place!
692	0	Where do I start, beautiful set up, pretty good food if you come during the day or dinner but as far as the nighclub it is not my top choice.   It is extremely difficult to get in, my group was walking out at 3am and there was still a few folks coming in.  the lines are huge, if you are going try to find some list, vip passes, or something to get you off the regular admission.  The club was overcrowded memorial day weekend, extrememly difficult to walk around, and even get in and out of dance floor.  Once on the dance floor it was shoulder to shoulder so you are rubbing against everyone next to you.   general admission for guys is 70, and 30 for ladies. The crowd is young and mostly attractive so I know why folks go to this lenght to get in, I dont think I will be returning.
693	1	Can't believe that ive skipped thisplace so many ti es. Ive been coming to vegas every year since 92 and from the strip it didnt seem worth the stop.  Should have fead the revies. Found it by doing a google search of must see and best of.  Be careful what you order. HUGE HUGE food.  Delicious and top quality. I got a fantastic buger with incredible rings. The environment was fantastic too.  A must see.  The bar area has spectacular ambiance. GOT TO SEE!
694	0	Over priced and dreadful Chinese food tucked in to a corner of Ceasar's Palace.  Wish I could have that meal and my money back.  By far the worse experienced I have had in Las Vegas.  I would have complained had there been one person there who seemed remotely interested in my experience.  Run, run, run the other way.
695	0	Was so excited to come try out the food for my 21st birthday an was extremely beyond disappointed. The service was terrible the guy at the windows answer to my 2 questions about the food I was ordering were simply "I don't know". Then I got my 13 dollar fries an hot dog that I ended up throwing away because the bread was so stale an dry I literally have never had bread that stale ever it was gross an me being as pissed off as I was lost my appetite an threw it all away no point in eating something that gross anyways. I don't recommend this place at all I give it -5 stars never been to a place this terrible ever.
696	0	Yes another DAMN YOU PRICELINE on this one.  Ok sure it's a block from MGM Grand and the intersection to Excalibur and New York New York, but it's a loooooong block and so totally NOT on the strip.  The place reeked of cigarette smoke for a non-smoking room, paint was peeling, the rug had really creepy red stains... and walking through the lobby was a horror every single time.  On top of that when I checked in (with great effort to drag my butt into this place let me tell you) it took the guy in training 30 minutes to find my priceline reservation, going back and forth to a back room, getting the lady next to him for help... and on top of that I discover they charged me themselves so I paid double for the rooms!  Now I have to dispute the freakin thing.
697	1	Got there around 6pm on Thursday.  Line wasn't very long.  Hostess was wonderful.  As you got in line she came by to give you an idea of how long the wait was.  Our waitress, Mia, was absolutely wonderful.  You could tell that she loved her job.  I had the super antioxidant cocktail....yum.  The American burger was flavorful and cooked perfectly.  My husband had the Farm burger which was also cooked perfectly.  We shared the plain fries which were good with the chipotle ketchup.  I'm not a fan of curry so I didn't really like the curry ketchup but that is just personal taste.  Definitely worth the $$.
698	1	One of my absolute favorite restaurants!  The burger quality is perfect.  I usually go for well done because I don't like ANY pink but when I come to Bachi I make sure I order it medium rare because the flavor is SO much better.  The service here is quite slow and often times they have forgotten an item we ordered but to me its absolutely worth the wait.  We always get the garlic chili edamame, truffle fries and salt and vinegar fries.   We also love the Oxtail fries but really recommend to buy it when you're with a bigger group since it is  A LOT of food.   ENJOY!  :D
699	0	This place was just bad. Stayed at the hotel and tried using their $20 off coupon featured in their booklet only to find out after waiting 30+ minutes in line that the coupon is only accepted if you buy the whole day meal deal so having waited so long I bit the bullet and still went with it. Big mistake on my part. Over scrambled eggs, rubbery pancakes,  dry waffles, bland sausages. Maybe I picked the wrong things but just seemed all over poor quality for a meal that's usually hard to mess up. Even the chocolate milk tasted off (how do you mess up chocolate milk!!) would recommend looking up better places.
700	1	My 5 stars are for the Rossini burger ALONE, nothing else, not the service or anything else on the menu. Kobe beef, sauted foie gras, shaved truffles, Madeira sauce, on onion bun - are you kidding me? I know to some people it may sound over the top - but it was EXCELLENT. One of the best burgers I have ever had. It is quite pricey, but I would pay that amount of money to taste those flavors again. Unforgettable, indescribable... too much goodness in one burger.  Thank you Chef Keller for creating this tangible dream. (July 2012)
701	0	This might be my first one star review. Awful, especially for the price.  Where do I begin? Slimy bagged lettuce, ridiculously runny poached eggs, mushy fruit, and KRAFT ranch dressing (all their dressings). All meat entrees were bad and dry. Nothing tasted good, seriously. For 24$ a person for lunch?! Ridiculous. Told server food was bad, he didn't seem to care. Not much he can do I guess. Go spend your hard earned money elsewhere for good quality food. I hear Cesar's Palace Buffet is good. Bellagio and Monte Carlo are decent. Shoot, even Golden Corral is better. Stay far away from Bayside Buffet.
702	1	One of the best Thai restaurants in the USA and I've been to Thailand for 3 weeks and to some of the top Thai populated places in America (NYC, SF, LA, etc).  Lotus of Siam's flavors and prices are just greatness. Don't get the usual boring pad thai and chicken satays, go for the unique dishes like spicy red duck curry, coconut shrimp specialties, and any of the house specials. Everything is great.  It's only a few min, very short cab ride from the city, you could technically even walk there if you're near Spring Mountain. Yum!
703	0	The line to pay and then to be seated on a Saturday (07/12/14) night around 7pm was not bad at all. As far as the food goes I had some really impressive salads (a fruit one comes to mind). I liked the entree options but nothing was that memorable. Pretty standard Vegas buffet food.  The one problem that I was that my boyfriend added on the all you can drink (wine, beer, etc) option. We each ordered a beer (he was brought the wrong one, but just decided to drink it), his second he finally got the one he wanted, but this is where it went bad. He went to get another plate of food so I ordered his 3rd beer for him. It took 30+ minutes to get it which included being brushed off at the cashier station and then having to get the manager involved. The manager said he would talk to the waitress, but no real action was taken. I never went back up to try any of the deserts because I was at the table hoping we would get our drinks while he was having to actually leave the table to get served. I even contacted them when we got home and was told that they would give me a priority reservation the next time I went to the buffet.   My advice is if you eat there do not add the all you can drink option. I don't know if they only want to allow you to have 2, then they should call it $11.99 for 2 drinks. I am sure people would still order that.   There are a lot of options in Vegas so I will not be returning to this buffet. I may never stay at this hotel because of the level of non-customer service that we received which is a shame because it was an option for our upcoming trip.
704	1	Love this place--it's like Cheers, everybody knows my name! Been eating here since I was in Elementary school....did you know this place opened up in 1983? Just a little food for thought! :)  Anyway, about the food...I love and highly suggest the: -Italian skillet -Corn beef hash And my new favorite... -Pork Carnitas!!!!!! (Drool)  Do yourself a favor and give this place a shot, it's an oldie but a goodie! :)
705	1	This is the best food I have ever eaten...  The parking lot is a bit sketchy...watch out for bums.    Service is pretty good.  If you plan to eat here on a weekend or when during the tech conventions, you will need to get a reservation.    You can't go wrong with anything on the menus.   Good selection for vegans.
706	1	What a great place. It has it. The pizza trifecta: cheap, delicious, and open late.  The employees were all also upbeat and friendly, and when we accidentally dumped an entire jar of red peppers (make sure your lid is closed tightly), they warmed up another slice for us without hesitation.   My only gripe, it was unreasonably cold inside. I am not sure why. But it was freezing.
707	1	This is one of my favorite places to take friends from out of town- I have friends who saw this on Man vs. Food and were dying to try it.  They absolutely loved it, and of course none of us could finish our meals.  I love the chicken and waffles, which is big enough for two people to split and have some left over to take home. My second favorite dish is the grilled cheese with avocado, each slice of bread is close to 2 inches thick, and that's amazing in my book.  The second best thing is the drink menu, which has all sorts of amazing drinks that are basically desserts in their own right- hot chocolate, flavored coffee and cappucinos, etc.  I don't drink alcohol, so it's always nice to see a drink menu with special items that I can actually enjoy.
708	1	My boyfriend brought me here for breakfast in Las Vegas.  I love dating a fellow foodie, he makes magic happen for me.  He had the chicken and waffles (roasted chicken, bacon and chive waffle, Tahitian vanilla bean butter, sauce chasseur) and I had the sourdough waffles with bananas, toasted walnuts, maple syrup & Tahitian vanilla bean butter.  It was sheer heaven.    We both had cocktails, mine had an edible flower in it.  The whole meal was a complete treat.  I would recommend highly and return.  The wait staff was amazing too.
709	0	It's a 2...because we didn't spit it out LOL. That's a good start, right? Makes your mouth water? It also gets a 2 instead of a 1 because it was very organized. The line looked really long, but we were only in line for about 10-15 minutes and then it took maybe another 5 to get the actual food.  So here's the deal. My husband and I have lived in So-Cal all our lives, so even though we've always heard of White Castle---the East Coast version of In n Out, we had never gotten to try it. We were SUPER excited when we randomly saw they had one in Vegas that we had to stop and try it! Yay!  We had seen the frozen ones at Ralphs for years, but didn't ever want to ruin our first experience for when we did eventually get to try the real thing....in hindsight I feel like the frozen ones might actually be better!  We weren't very hungry so we just ordered 2 cheese sliders and 1 double cheese slider with no onions for me. PROTIP: Yes you can order individually even though they aren't on the menu that way.  We were lucky enough to instantly find a table (it was packed), sat down, and dug in. Upon first bite we both looked at each other with a WTF look on our faces. We had waited years to try this? Avoided the frozen version? Waited in line. Ew.  The buns were soggy and wet, the meat was gray. Not a good combination. Like I said we didn't spit them out, so I guess it gets a 2 star, but OMG they were pretty close to terrible.   This is what all the hype is about? I admit I think they're cute in those little boxes, but the compliments pretty much end there.   I think I figured it out though...you must have to be high riding on white tigers like Harold and Kumar to be able to say you enjoyed those things.  Thanks but no thanks White Castle...ew.  In N Out for the win....West Coast 4eva!
710	1	Love love this place.The orange juice is freshly squeezed and sweet. Worth the money they charge. Big portions and reasonably priced. Very clean, great customer service. Haven't had a bad experience yet. Open 24/7 which is a good thing. The pastas are really good.
711	0	Get ready for a cheesy south-of-the-border inauthentic experience, with sexist, insulting quotes hanging above the bar (like - the more you drink, the better she'll look). Because this is what you get in Vegas. A nice spot on the strip for people watching, but don't expect much from the food. The food was mostly bland, except for the "spicy" dishes which were just doused in hot sauce. I'm sure there is good Mexican or Texmex in Vegas, but you'll probably have to get further from the strip.
712	0	Worse Customer Service PERIOD! Never come back here again! From front desk to Manager they are all rude. We got the luxury  room booked with 2 double bed. They gave us King bed and my mom end up sleeping on folding bed. Talk to the manager if she can move us to another said NO. Once you get a room, you will never able to move to another room. When we got in the room, the bath tub has 2 long hair! DO NOT BELIEVE the Hotel Amenities: saying they have Sauna, Steam room. NO,  THEY DO NOT HAVE THOSE. I would recommend downtown hotels or the expensive hotels.
713	1	Had an excellent breakfast here on May 6, but definitely could not finish it! The grilled mash potatoes were outrageous and the corned beef hash had huge pieces of corn beef in it.  I really liked the industrial feel to the decor, very cute.  Service was excellent too.  We had  a bit of a wait, but only about 20 minutes and it was worth it! Excellent quality and taste!
714	0	This review is for the casino only, and after hanging out there for a couple hours, I probably would not consider getting a room here, even if it was free. I'm the kind of person that doesn't mind paying a little more for service, or at least some personality.   I dropped my money off at the blackjack tables, and the roullete table, and of the six or seven different dealers that ran them, NOT ONE was polite, funny or even smiling. If you're gonna take my money, at least give me a smile. Smiles are free at McDonalds, and they have a dollar menu. The last table I played, the Roullete dealer barked at me for picking up my chips too soon, and gave me a look that made me want to knock his nose in. The waitress that was taking drinks at first did not want to give me a drink because I wasn't seated, and when I showed her my stack of chips on the table, she rolled her eyes back and said, "well whadda ya want then?" Don't these people work on tips? Yeah, stay the hell away from this place.
715	0	DISGUSTING!!!! If it wasn't for the Spa Trade Show, I would have not stayed there. Convenient to the Convention Center, I thought I would stay here the first night and when a coworker came the following day, we would stay at the Renaissance next door.  The rooms look like it hasn't been remodeled since the 80's, okay, I'm okay with just a comfy bed and a TV., since I was alone the first night, I wasn't planning to have a wild night in Vegas. I wanted to order room service and call it a night. Room service food was horrible. When you order a chocolate Milk Shake and the whip cream that sits on the top is still floating completely in tact the following morning, you wonder what it was made of. Don't bother to ask for a Non-Smoking room, even though you may have one, doesn't mean your next door neighbor is, to wake up to the smell of smoke is not how I want to start my morning. BUT... the worse fear came that morning. Sitting on the royal thrown, what do I have stare at first thing in the morning a HUGE COCKROACH was staring me by my feet. Flipped out, jumped on the bed, the thing decided to follow me to across the room. It was like the roach was pissed I was in it's room.  I packed all my stuff and checked out at 9:30 A.M. walked across to the Marriott and sat in the coffee bar for an hour until my co- worker showed up. I'm okay with roughing it, but this was way too much!
716	1	Has to be the Best Korean BBQ in Las Vegas.  From the time we entered to the time we left everyone and everything was the best. Service, food  ect... Their were four of us we ordered the 4 people meat lovers meal. From the start the food was excellent and then it just keep coming and coming, If you walk away from this table hungry you must not like Korean food. Their is probably more then enough food to feed 5 or 6 people.  This is a must for Korean BBQ. I will be back.
717	0	It is as if someone wanted to bring the Laughlin experience to the Las Vegas Strip. The bed was comfortable and the room was quiet. However, for $250 a night, I would like a place with restrooms somewhere near the restaurants. A hundred small things make this a "never to repeat" adventure.
718	0	For the decor, ambiance, and music I'd give it 5 stars. For the rude staff, overly cramped space, and admission fee, despite being escorted in by a promoter friend, this place gets 2 stars.  Came here once with a large group of friends who were all on the guestlist. Our promoter friend was generous enough to help get us all in, but a few of us came through maybe 10 min after the first group. Due to our ratio, and despite our friend talking to the bouncers, the guys still had to pay $30 to get in. Whack!   Later on, I got yelled out by a bouncer "for being extremely rude" because I hopped over ledge to try an get to the dance floor, only because there was ZERO walking spaces in the accessible hallways. Maybe he should have done a better job clearing the hallway.  One perk of the night was that Tao Beach was open, which is awesome for cooling down and there's a huge sofa bed to just chill, or get ridiculously bouncy and slizzard.  Definitely best to get in before 11, because once that time hits, you're going to want to leave because there's no space or room to do anything in the club
719	0	Honesty, I would want to give this place 1 star...but the Excalibur buffet is worse...which automatically bumps this place up to two stars....but let me tell you....it a VERY low 2 stars. NOTHING was exciting about this buffet. I do feel like I need to provide at least one positive thing, however the only positive thing I can think of is the seating arrangement. The seating is arranged so that it is not so "Cafeteria style". IDK if thats so much of a positive but that is the best I could do.   The food is bland, not seasoned well. Plain boring "Comforter food". Waaaaaaaay over priced for the food they provide. I paid $38 for the all you can eat day pass, but will NEVER do that again. It is NOT a deal if you don't like the food and don't eat it. I tried a little bit of everything (My buffet ritual) But I literally took one bite and put it down and moved to the next. I honestly don't remember taking more than one bite of anything. It was gross.  I went to McDonald's an hour later and had the best meal I had that day. And I don't even eat McDonald's. Ok so perhaps I'm being a little harsh....but to be honest, you can pay that same exact price to eat at the Wicked Spoon (BEST BUFFET ON THE STRIP, Don't believe yelp it)  anyways like I was saying, you can pay the same price, and eat like a Queen or King until you are stuffed!! And you still will want to eat because EVERYTHING is so tasty, you'll be so stuffed you won't need to eat for the rest of the day. ( At least that is what happened to me on several occasions) There fore, you are pretty much paying the same price for the days worth of food, but with a better experience. \  But bottom line, even if I were to get a free pass for this buffet, I would probably try to sell it to a foolish person for $5, take that and go put it in a slot machine. I wouldn't eat this food again if it were free, now, if I were starving...maybe...but then again,  it's Vegas...no such thing as starving....so nope...won't be eating here again EVER.    BLAH
720	0	My friend booked this room trying to save money!  We stayed at the Riviera after checking out of The Platinum Hotel on Sunday.  No need to spend another 169 dollars.  !    *However....A WORD TO THE WISE....IF YOU GET DRUNK ON SATURDAY, MAKE SURE YOU DONT HAVE TO CHECK OUT ON SUNDAY!  IT IS THE BIGGEST HASSLE AND GETTING UP EARLY TO CHECK INTO ANOTHER HOTEL IS THE WORST! *  Moving on...  THE HOTEL:  They have kiosks to check into this place like the airports.  The front desk staff are rude but you get what you pay for.  The rooms at the Riviera are better than I expected.  The beds are comfortable.  THE BATHROOM HAS BARLEY ENOUGH ROOM TO SIT ON THE TOILET WITH THE DOOR OPEN!  If you are trying to do Vegas on a dime...stay here!  But, cab fare will be a beast!      THE CASINO:  This casino IS OLD SCHOOL!!!!  It hasn't been renovated in a long time, and it shows.  EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PLACE IS OLD AND DUSTY.  NOTHING TO SEE HERE...the best thing about this place is the 7/11 next door and it is a short walk from The Wynn and Encore.    This dude was borderline stalking and harrassing me and I almost had to report him.  He followed me downstairs and it scared me.  Luckily he stopped.  Overall:  If your funds are limitied....stay here.  Otherwise, stay somewhere else and save peace of mind.
721	0	I've heard a lot of buzz around Pink's so when my girlfriends and I were in Vegas last month, we made sure to stop by.   I ordered the bacon burrito dog which is a tortilla with hot dogs, bacon, chilli, and cheese. While it wasn't bad, it wasn't anything amazing either. I found it a little too oily for my liking (which i guess shouldn't be surprising given the ingredients) and a little overpriced for a hot dog. I can spend $8 elsewhere and get more value.
722	0	Don't go unless you have a comp. No crab legs at lunch (so do dinner if you can). Everything was sweeter than usual (ex: plantains, shumai, seaweed salad, creme brulee). Jumbo shrimp and dessert were solid.  There are definitely better buffets in Vegas for the price.
723	1	Bachi Burger has an interesting menu for a burger joint. That's bc this joint serves no ordinary burgers! We began with the Bachi Pickles, an assortment of eight different types of pickles, all handmade and very delicious. We had the Sweet Potato Fries dusted with sea salt served up with Yuzu Citrus Aioli dipping sauce, a delicious match. Each of us ordered a burger - think of your juiciest most succulent backyard barbecue burger ever taking a quick trip to Japan and stopping off in Hawaii on the way back, and you have all the wonderful influences that make Bachi Burgers so wonderful. I ordered the Kiki Burger: 5 ounces (1/3 lb) of thick, juicy, tender, delicious Texas Kobe beef topped with caramelized bacon, Gruyere cheese, sweet onion marmalade, very tiny petite mushrooms and tender fresh cool greens, served on a warm bun. My dining partner enjoyed a Signature BBQ Bachi Burger, a tender 5 oz Angus Beef burger served up on a warm steamed bun with crispy cool lettuce, a thick slice of ripe tomato and thin slice of raw onion. Everything was better than we dreamed it would be! We look forward to our next visit.
724	1	THE FLAPJACKS ARE SO FLUFFY, I COULD DIE!  Prices are so reasonable, and with a restaurant.com coupon it was just dirt cheap. Portions are humongous, plan on making it two meals.  Everything we had on our table was ridiculously amazing. I can't believe I'd never been here before.  Blueberry flapjacks, meatloaf sandwich Komodo, and mushroom/spinach hash - all tasty, all mouthwateringly good.  My parents eyes got big and excited when they walked in here and saw the portion sizes... and my parents rarely get excited for western food.
725	1	This review is based on multiple meals here over the last year. When in Vegas for business, I am always sure to stop by Bouchon, Thomas Keller's stunning French bistro. The food is precise and on the money, the atmosphere is welcoming and classy without being stuffy, and the location (in the Venezia Tower, away from the usual Vegas crowds) is perfect.   The onion soup is, hands down, the best in the United States. Rich, creamy even, the essence of a few ingredients. The steak frites, while basic as a dish, is exactly how it should be served (with the fries taking the title as top notch). The rotisserie chicken is juicy and flavorful - the mark of true experts. The cold seafood platters (oysters, mussels, etc) is sourced from Keller's high end French Laundry purveyors - screaming fresh.   There are a lot of celebrity chef restaurants in Vegas that trade on their famous name. This one trades on the quality of the food. A must-visit.
726	1	Nothing has changed..excellent service, excellent food..very pricey but it's all worth it.  This time I had the ceasar salad, filet (medium rare), Mac and cheese, foie gras, bone marrow and the sticky toffee pudding...my plate was empty when I left and my tummy was very happy
727	1	Made a reservation because of Yelp reviews.  Drove into the crazy/odd parking lot and didn't drive out because of Yelp reviews.  Went inside - sat down - ordered salad rolls......it just felt right. There were many regular customers who were warmly welcomed, families and out of "towners" it just felt good in there! You could tell there were plenty of foodies - long conversations with waiters - people asking for "the best" and "you order for me, this is what I like...."  We ordered: Prawns on Drunken Noodles - I am rarely at a loss for words - all I could say when asked was - "I am so happy".   Beef dish with peanut sauce - also wonderful - though the previously mentioned was by far my favorite.   The service was as expected - prompt, tidy, nice but not overly solicitous. If you are looking for amazing waiters and ambiance go somewhere else. If you are looking for perfect - and I mean perfect food - please join in the feast - like many have said before - the place is so worth it.
728	0	Went in for dinner. Greg was our waiter. My friend wanted spaghetti and a salad. He told her she didn't want salad the pasta dish was enough. REALLY! We were both drinking alcohol. Was not asked if we wanted another drink. Brought check to table before plates were removed. REACHED OVER ME to grab my wine glass without asking if I was done or wanted another glass. His service and attitude were so bad I can't even remember what the food tasted like.
729	1	My niece loves Gordon Ramsay, so out of the 3 restaurant choices we went here. Friendly greeting at the door, manager came over and took us to a seat after a very short delay - great service!! I will state this right now - best service I've had in Vegas in a very long time. We even got the wrong fries, and the waiter came over and whisked them off the table saying "those aren't sweet potato fries". Fresh SP fries on the table within 3 mins.  I had the Bleu BurgR - very tasty. My niece went another direction with fresh jalapenos and sundried tomatoes and she enjoyed it. Very tasty for $14.  Nice selection of beers as well, a little light on cocktails. I know nothing about wines but they have some, and I saw quite a few tables enjoying theirs.   Overall, great service, good food. Probably 4.5 stars because the burgers took a long time to come out.
730	0	W. T. Freakazoid.  For the price it is not with it.  Service was fast and friendly but the food was lacking flavor and the selection wasn't all that great for a buffet.  The money they ask for would be better spent at one of the regular restaurants (or just spent on drinks at a bar) with a good entree and drink.
731	0	So I was in Vegas over the weekend and I have finally recovered! What a fun weekend! Of course with all Vegas weekends there is always some type of drama and unfortunately it was hotel drama. There was 3 of us checking in and our check in went smoothly, the room was nice but upon checking in we got in our room to find our toilet was not working. We called down to have it looked at, they sent engineering up to our room and the toilet was fixed. Fast forward a few hours and I got up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and it was broken AGAIN...I really had to go and went down stairs to the lobby to use the restroom. I went back up after I was done, my key had been demagnetized so I had to go to the front desk to get a new key and I mentioned to the front desk person what was happening with the toilet and he was very receptive to my issue. He said we could move rooms in the morning (it was 4am) AWESOME. I went back up to the room and went back to bed. In the morning I mentioned to the girls what happened and called down to move rooms. You would think I dreamt the whole conversation with the front desk guy no one had record of the conversation, the issue or even the engineer visit upon our arrival!!. We had such an issue trying to get a new room, they finally did it but after we went downstairs to speak with guest services and a conversation with the manager. He was a smug individual and I am so surprised that this man is even in the hospitality field. He was condescending and rude and made us feel like whiny bitches. We changed rooms, bathroom worked YES!!! AC did not work well but at this point a working toilet was all I needed and as long as the room was at a comfortable temp I guess it would be fine. The one star is for the shower heads, AWESOME shower heads, water pressure and loved it so much I was taking 2 showers a day. The location is a block off the strip BUT there are a lot of questionable characters in this area, homeless people. They have a little drinking area right next to the hotel in an open lot. We were fine walking in the daytime to the strip but at night a cab was necessary. Looked a little shady. I missed the excitement of a cool Vegas hotel, I will definitely be hitting up a hotel on the strip and never stay at this hotel again.
732	1	Delicious food and great service! We had the prime rib Benny and strawberry cream French toast. The potatoes that come with the Benny are soooo good; crispy and well-seasoned. Perry and the other staff were very attentive and friendly. :) I recommend if you have a larger group, call ahead and make a reservation  And don't forget to check in and get a free, warm banana nut muffin!
733	1	The cheese plate is to die for!  We celebrated our 30th Anniversary dinner here and yes it was wonderful.  The only unfortunate thing was that our appetizer, the Fromage du Jour   cheese plate was so amazing, our entrees were not the star of the show.  I ordered the  Poulet Rti and my husband ordered the Gigot d'Agneau both delish.  Great service and the ambiance was wonderfully romantic.
734	0	The worst food I've had in my life.  Service was hurried and the server scowled at us throughout.  Admittedly, the place was crowded but please - do your job professionally.  This place is not cheap.  $15 or so for a Cobb salad.  The lettuce was dry and tasteless, and straight from the freezer.  The chicken breasts were still icy cold and the whole plate was dry - not a drop of dressing.  The bacon bits were so dry that they chafed my mouth.  I had a bite, and even though I was hungry, I didn't eat another spoon.  The server just checked on us once more to serve us water and we didn't see her again until she came back with the whopping bill.  I didn't dare to send the food back or complain because I've heard of stories of American servers spitting in food and worse.  I just paid the bill - hope you learn from my terrible experinece and go someplace better.  We love the food at Venetians.  Go spend your hard-earned money in a better place.
735	0	If you want to be squished by hundreds of sweaty strangers with out even room to dance then come here. The restaurant is nice and I like the atmosphere the club has but Tao needs to seriously crowd control they let too many people in too fast, I was over it after 30 min. Not to mention the quality of people we ran into, maybe it was just random but this fat drunk Mexican literally feel on top of my girlfriend. My GF playfully smacked her ass when she got up. Apparently she didn't like that and started charging at my GF then tried to swing at her. Held back by all of her friends she finally stoped acting dumb and went away. I latter saw the same girl trying to dance on the stage where the bouncer kicked her off for being to raunchy. Thursday night might be better but I won't be going back. I've heard marquee and XS are much better clubs.
736	1	I will keep it simple. It's very rare to enjoy a duck bacon burger cooked the way I ordered it as much as this burger. I also want to add that the fries at Gordon Ramsey burger where just as good as the burger.  As other reviews have written they had a long wait to be seated, I was lucky to have a short 10 min wait.
737	1	Shack Stack cheeseburger is much better than In N Out. The crisp-fried Portobello mushroom filled with melted cheese was so yummy! Cheese Fries is OK, and Coffee Shade is too sweet for me. And the prices are are much higher than In N Out. I will come back again.
738	1	Words cannot describe what my mouth tastes  hahaha but seriously I would definitely recommend coming here anytime, if you are coming back or coming here for the first time. It was really good and different than other burger places like in and out. The bun is really soft and the quantity and size of the burger is perfect; enough to be full along with fries and a shake! I also bought the caramel shake and it tasted really good! It's not too sweet and not too dull so I really enjoyed it! I don't know if the Shake Shack here tastes like the Shake Shack from New York, but it's really good and I would come back! Like I said, I would highly recommend coming here for burgers, fries, shakes, and/or hot dogs! Great job!
739	1	Bouchon has never let me down! I've been to the one in Napa, the one in New York, and now the one in Vegas, and I am very pleased with the consistency across the board.  For a well-established restaurant, I was surprised that it was so hidden and impossible to find. We literally walked all the way around the Venetian, but the signs (like all of the signs in Vegas) were tiny and completely miss-able and finally had to stop and ask someone. Basically, you have to find the Venezia Tower, which is guarded by security, take the elevator to the 10th floor, which is a SEPARATE button not in the normal numerical sequence, and then go pass another security guard. Crazy, no wonder it was completely empty when we got there around lunch time!  Anyways, the interiors were beautiful as usual - the perfect composition of dark grains and warm, natural light. Our service wasn't stellar, but it was good enough.  But the FOOD definitely saved it for me. We ordered the sourdough waffles and the florentine quiche. The waffles came with super ripe strawberries and vanilla bean butter - a brilliant sweet complement to the slight hint of sourdough. The quiche, which was my first, was so melt-in-my-mouth-good. Nothing was overpowering, and I didn't feel yucky at the end. I will definitely have a a high standard for quiches from now on.  I wish there was a Bouchon in the city; I'm dying for some waffles right now!
740	1	Wow what a find! My wife and I took a walk up "The Strip" from Wynn and we stumbled across this place for breakfast. The portions are great and the food was outstanding! It is diner type food, but a bit higher style and quality.  Very nice change of pace as far as price/service goes from the options in the hotels! We felt very welcomed by the staff.   We would recommend this to anyone staying on the North or Mid points on "The Strip"; It's an easy walk and on the east side of the road.
741	1	LOVE this place.  The promotional materials say that BurGR "takes the traditional burger, fries and milkshake comfort food combination to an entirely new level," and that's not hyperbole.  We had the Uber Cheese Burger (3 kinds of cheese, fantastic gooey goodness), the Chicken Sliders (good sized, a little aggressively spiced) and the truffle fries (huge portion, more than enough for two to split).  Nothing disappointed, and it was enough food that we didn't finish the fries, despite our best efforts.  Our servers were both terrific: Gianna, who my date described as "put-her-in-a-teacup-cute," and Alex, who knows his way around a beer list.  (On that note, the beer list here is not world-beating, but is passably broad and reasonably priced.)  The servers and host staff are decked out in form-fitting '60s-flight-attendant-inspired uniforms, which is a nice touch and good eye candy.  Easily a level above Holstein's at the Cosmo.  I'll definitely be back.
742	1	Literally, this place has the best burger I've eaten in my entire life. So good I went two days in a row. I make it a point to come here every time I visit Vegas.   Only problem, which I can't dock stars for nor would I, this place is only in Vegas. Please please please open up a restaurant in LA!
743	1	Great food and good service. The Shackcago Dog was just perfect for me. And the shake was great. Crispy crinkle fries with not too much salt were tasty. Got there at 10:30 am and there was already a line. Once it opened the line moved pretty quickly. I'm local and will definitely go again.
744	1	One of the greatest dining experiences I've had all year, maybe all life. Burger was succulent, excellent roll, each bite was juicy and delicious. The Oreo Milkshake had some amazing aftertastes, and the entire experience from onion rings to fried pickles was a heavy one.  I went into a food coma afterwards for about 1/2 a day.  We ate at 4 p.m., and I was done for the rest of the day!  Highly, highly recommended.
745	1	Best steak of my life! I'm not kidding! This place is fantastic- I don't even know where to begin. I didn't think the greens beans would be one of the most memorable parts of my dish. I think it caught me off guard how amazing green beans could taste. The steak is out of this world- it cuts like butter. And there isn't a better way to end your meal than with sticky toffee pudding!
746	1	Fabulous little dive off the strip. Go early for breakfast. There was no wait on the Saturday morning I visited. This breakfast was very well worth the Uber drive. My waitress, Tamara, was awesome. She recommended the Bandito (if you like spicy food!) and was SO right! The house breakfast potatoes are amazing and you must take advantage of the Banana nut muffin offer on Yelp. Even if you are full, take one home! Absolutely a must do when you are ready to escape the lavish buffets of the strip!
747	1	Located in the Venetian Resort Spa Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. This 24 hour coffee shop deluxe has quite the extensive menu. The prices are very reasonable and the portions huge. I can recommend any one of the burgers, sandwiches or salads. Everything here gets top marks. Go on an off hour so as to avoid lines. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!
748	1	This is probably one of the best (if not the best) Thai places I've been to. I make it a point to visit Lotus of Siam every time I visit LV. Please *please* order something special off their expansive menu, and not just stick with the ho-hum. The flavors are multifaceted, and not just overpowered by one spice... Though I do have one story to tell.....  So, I ate here once a couple of years ago with my wife and our Joisey friends. Everyone else were pansies and ordered a "3" or "4" spiciness for their dishes, and of course I ordered an "8" for my Kang Hoh - a stir-fry pork dish with different veggies sprinkled about. I was having the greatest time with it... until I bit into this orange pepper. It took about half a second before my whole body went berserk. Apparently, if you order an "8", they cook the dish with habaneros, then they were supposed to take it out. But they missed one. Let's just say that this lone pepper hurt me again and again for the next 12 hours. And I was the butt of all jokes for the rest of the trip.
749	1	We were able to get reservations for 7:30 on Saturday only a week or two before. The koi soy (beef tartare) was excellent, as was the the mashed jackfruit dish (very surprising!) and papaya salad (which is very spicy but quite authentic. The khao soi was all right but not amazing. The whole fried catfish with basil was great, and the northern larb was pretty good but again not exceptional. The wine list is truly something, and there are plenty of other drinks as well. Service is very good and friendly and the prices are not bad, especially for vegas.
750	1	There was a short wait when we came on a Saturday around 2pm. It was only 10-15mins so it was not too bad. I wanted to order from the lunch menu but they don't have that option for weekends. However, they have the happy hour menu from 3-6pm, look good but I already over ordered from the regular menu. Onto the food, we got harami miso, Korean prime Kali, spicy tuna kimbap, fried calamari, bibimbap, and spicy tofu soup. Imo, everything was good, except the tofu soup. The meat cut was high quality, so tender and well seasoned. The appetizers are fried perfectly. Bibimbap was good, but at $12.99, i think I rather get another meat dish instead. The soup was just so so, not memorable.  The service was okay, no smile when greetings, but otherwise attentive. I would definitely visit again, with a reservation, since I don't like to wait an hour wait for any food.
751	1	I love breakfast food, especially pancakes and omelets.  So when a friend recommended trying this place, I was down to give it a try.  I had high expectations and I wasn't disappointed!  I like how they give you a carafe of coffee when you order a cup (like IHOP) so you don't have to constantly wait to get refilled.  Since I usually drink 3-5 cups every morning, this was a plus.  As far as the food, it also met my expectations.  I decided to try the egg-ceptional omelet (has bacon, mushrooms, ham, peppers, onions and sour cream) and not only was it delicious, it was more than enough food to last me through lunch.  I wanted to try the pancakes as well but I couldn't get it as a side so i tried the banana nut muffin that other reviewers had recommended - it was good but not great, but I'm not a big fan of banana nut in the first place so others may enjoy it, i don't know.    The overall price was reasonable and I prefer quality over quantity and other than a handful of a few breakfast places on the strip the Egg and I is one of the best breakfast places around Vegas.  Highly recommended!
752	1	We had a wonderful brunch at Bouchon! Tao and Alberto were our servers and they were both incredible...attentive and very nice! I had the 3 egg omelet which was delicious. My mom had the quiche and she said it was excellent. My sister had the banana waffle and it was amazing too! It was my mom's birthday and Tao treated us to their lemon tarte complete with a candle on top! I don't care for lemon desserts but I'll admit I really enjoyed this one!
753	1	Loved this place! Everything was exceptional; the service was excellent, the restaurant was extremely busy, my friend and I both ordered the Chef Ramses' infamous beef Wellington. We waited two hours to receive our entrees :( definitely worth the wait. I ordered the mac and cheese and my friend ordered the asparagus to accompany our meals. When we finally received our entrees it was too late to eat our sides, we just devoured our wellingtons. Food was delicious, will definitely recommend an earlier reservation on the weekends since it's so busy, food takes longer to arrive. It does say on the menu beef Wellington will take about 45 min to cook but 2 hours was a bit too long.
754	0	04/19/12 DINNER.  What misery. And sadness.  After nearly 1.5 years of living in Las Vegas, this has to be one of the WORST meals we've ever had here.  We used to go to the Pink's in LA a bit, as we lived in LA for a LONG time up until our move to Vegas in Dec 2010.   So we expected SOME quality.   Boy were we wrong.   And even with a $15 coupon, it was WAY too expensive. RIDICULOUSLY expensive.  Never again.  I had a polish/pastrami "classic" thing, SUPPOSEDLY with swiss. (Swiss air?) Spouse had a "baja" dog, or some such (he was like "HOW did they remove ALL flavor from jalapenos?") and some polish thing. All were just awful.  The fries were way too salty. Virtually inedible.  Very sad, that we can't get the Pink's of yesteryear. (Then again, we've heard sad rumors about the original, too, but we can't vouch, as we haven't been in so long.)  So avoid this joint, if you know better!  PS And you know what the WORST thing about this is? This franchise of Pink's is run by Block 16 Hospitality, the same people that brought to LV the following restaurants: Holstein's, LBS Burgers, Barrymore, Public House. I've been to 3 out of 4 of those, and have been from "quite pleased" to downright "in awe". So this failure in their portfolio should be jettisoned IMMEDIATELY!
755	1	I took my girlfriend here for our one year anniversary last night. It was my first time there, but I had always heard great things about this place, so I figured I'd share this as another first with my girl and I'm glad I made that decision. There's a lounge where you can just sit and have a drink by the fire (the drinks were awesome!) And the cocktail waitresses were so nice. After a few drinks, we walked over to the dining room, which had a 50's retro feel. Our server Samantha was so nice. If you're looking for a nice place to go to for chorizo and eggs, pancakes, or any other feel-good food, come down to this place and enjoy!!
756	1	I've been meaning to start writing Yelp reviews for a while now, and I've repeatedly considered what business would receive my first review. I've decided that it HAS to be the Peppermill and it HAS to be five stars.  (For this review, I'm focusing strictly on the lounge.)  My wife and I are Las Vegas locals now, but we've been frequenting the Fireside Lounge since our tourist days. We came here on the night we got engaged. We came here on the night we got married. We come here on our birthdays and anniversaries. There simply isn't any place in town more comfortable and romantic for a couple of kitsch lovers like us.  Sure, the strip location means it gets crowded on the weekends - moreso lately than it used to, it seems - but scoring a seat on one of the plush pink couches around the firepit makes it more than worth the trip. The waitresses are super-friendly and they'll remember you between visits.  My only complaints are that the drinks are a little weak and the music selection a little poppy. The former is because I've been conditioned by super-strong Fink Bombs at Frankie's Tiki Room, and the latter is because I'm apparently a hipster douche. Neither complaint is worth tarnishing a perfect score.  The Peppermill is easily one of our favorite places on the entire globe and now it's only a couple of miles down the street from us. We're so lucky to now live so close to this neon-encrusted gem.
757	1	THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!  I was in Vegas and decided to try this place and the burgers are amazing.  I had to go back again before we left Vegas (we never eat the same place twice).  This place is worth it.  I would go back to Vegas just to have these burgers and I am not even a Burger person.
758	0	if you want CHEAP ROOMS this could be the place ...just be prepared to bend over for anything else...breakfast buffet is mediocre at best and it's $16.99...go next door to the Peppermill and get REAL FOOD Slot and poker pay backs are the worst in the valley, best described as rob and pillage because it certainly isn't gambling  I'm a local and I know when I'm getting shafted, video poker min pay in $20 w/ max play to qualify for a $1 draft beer....in over a year I actually broke EVEN TWICE!!!  I now play elsewhere and experience true Vegas Value
759	0	I don't get it.  We had bottle service.  The drinks were meh.  The music wasn't much better.  I couldn't get my dance on.  Tao kept launching streamers in the air which of course landed in my champagne each and every time.  Strict dress code.  *Please keep in mind that I am not a clubber, I like to lounge Hollywood style.
760	0	Terrible. Used to be the diamond in the rough every year up until this yearly trip.   They reduced the cost of dinner to 28 dollars but the food selection is now half of what it used to be  Also, at the start of dinner at around 530pm one would expect fresh food, but most of it had the 4 hour under a dry heat lamp look to it.  Asked our server why the food looked stale and he said it shouldn't.. Ill pass it along to the manager *rollseyes*  Lastly food quality dramatically dropped. Save your money and goto McDonald's instead for better food quality
761	1	Ok, I didn't actually EAT here bcs it only has gluten- ous pizza (boo) but someday, when there is a cure... This is the pizza I'm going to eat. After planning a huge event at Cosmo, this is where I recommended people go and eat. Looks like traditional NY style pizza.
762	0	So far crap! Can't check-in until 4 unless we want a full bed. Then tried to check-in at 4 and told all they had was a handicapped accessible room with a double bed. Said needed to wait another 40 minutes. Smells like smoke in the empty lobby where they are supposedly full! Do not book via Priceline!
763	1	After a long flight from Chicago to Vegas that got me in at around 10PM local time, my friend recommended we immediately make our way to the Burger Bar inbetween Luxor and Mandalay Bay as he heard good things about their milkshakes. Though skeptical, I have to say I was intrigued by the prospects of a good milkshake and a burger. Little did I know that not only were these milkshakes everything he had built them up to be but the burgers were incredible as well. Good texture, perfectly cooked and highly recommend a side of sweet potato fries - which are also amazing. And you'd be doing yourself a huge disservice by just doing the burger without the milkshake. The Black White Milkshake may well be he world's perfect dessert. Chocolate mousse whipped cream with chocolate chips and fudge swimming in vanilla ice cream? Are you kidding me? We went back the night before I left just so I could have another for the road! Nice atmosphere and good service both at the tables and the bar.
764	1	Muslims have Mecca. Surfers have the North Shore. Hillbillys have NASCAR tracks. Everyone has their own personal Holy Land. Mine is Hash House A Go Go.   I started writing yelp reviews because I love breakfast. Now that I have been to Hash House A Go Go I might weep like Alexander the Great because there are no more worthy breakfast places to conquer.  We arrived to a packed house on a thursday mid morning to a packed house. It is always busy. We sat at the bar and introduced ourselves to Randy the bartender, who was cool as hell. While he was super busy, he didn't give a hurry up vibe.   My buddy Bear, (who has eaten Sayler's 72oz steak and fixings, making him my personal hero) stated he was hungry and order the fried chix eggs benedict and an additional waffle. Randy asked him if he was sure because that was going to be a lot of food.  Bear said 'I'm hungry".  Randy said "If you finish it all I will buy the waffle"  Line in the sand drawn, challenge accepted.   The fried chick benny is awesome. Fried cheese. Biscuits. Mashed taters. Eggs. Something green. Heaven. I couldn't finish mine.  One of the guys, Steve, had the most delecious smelling and looking plates of french toast I have ever witnessed complete with fried bananas on top. Indeed it was the Best French Toast Ever because we went back the next morning and I had it.   Back to the Challenge. Bear gave it it a mighty attempt, eventually mixing all the waffle and benedict together and shoveling it in. In the end the waffle got the better of him. Randy said it is the farthest he has seen someone get. He asked Bear who should take the ticket for the Waffle. Like a trooper Bear said "Right here. I couldn't do it"  I think Randy appreciated Bear's stand and bought the waffle anyway. It was awesome.    If you go to Las Vegas, get off the strip and try this place. I am looking for a vacation condo near it, so I can live near the Holy Land.
765	0	Meh~~~ Been here once during the 4th of July Weekend There are better Buffets out there. Pricewise, it is okay, compared to other buffets and prices.  Quality of food, pretty low, and not that great.  Mexican/"Latino" (Paella, 1 type of empanada, tacos, fajitas etc), Pasta (you can ask to be made, 2-3 options of noodles), Seafood (a bit fishy, but okay), "Chinese" Food (not that great, noodles soggy, and fried spring rolls soggy), Prime rib steak (it was great, not too dry, or hard), pastries/cookies/ice cream.   Servers were a bit laggy... but not that bad. very nice servers, working so hard.  it takes a bit to take away your used plates.
766	1	First time trying Korean BBQ and we were very impressed and satisfied. It was about a 30 minute wait, but very worth it! It was more food than we expected so better come hungry! We got the Gangman package for 2 and we could not finish it all. It was all very delicious! We will definitely return next time we come to Vegas!
767	0	Hate to give it one star, but it truly deserves it.  I am accustomed to coming to Vegas and eating pretty decently, even on the cheap.  I was so sad that this place disappointed me so much especially being in Planet Hollywood.  First thing first, someone in our party tore a muscle in his leg the night before and was in a wheelchair.  The hostess asked him if he was drunk.  We were all so offended, he just wanted to eat.  Feed the man.  We come to the table and we aren't too sure who our server is because no one really introduced themselves.  First, a girl comes with water and spills all three waters, some of it landing on me.  Ice and lemons are all over the carpeted floor and they leave it there!  A gentleman takes our orders and comes back because he didn't write down our order and had to clarify.  I ordered the Corned Beef Hash and it was not a good idea.    Overall, bad experience and will not be back.
768	1	We heard that breakfast here was a chance to eat a fairly affordable meal ($15-$22) at a Thomas Keller restaurant.  We came here on a weekday morning just after 9am and were seated promptly with a smile, a few rows away from the small pool outside (the hostess joked that it was the Venetian's "kiddie pool").  The restaurant is smaller than I thought it would be, with very high ceilings and an airy, sunlit atmosphere.    I had the Breakfast Jardiniere with eggs over medium, choosing a chocolate croissant.  It was obvious that the chefs really pay attention to the details.  The croissant came first with a cup of fruit.  Flaky and amazingly buttery, the croissant had delicious bittersweet chunks of chocolate.  Each cube of fruit, whether grape or cantaloupe, was sweet and ripe.   The eggs came with a toasted brioche, sauteed spinach, and a side of potatoes cut to the size of nickels.  The eggs were an incredibly deep yellow color (from naturally-raised chickens, perhaps?) that I haven't seen from eggs in ages.  The light oil and salt on the potatoes made for a tiny dance of flavor in my mouth.  The sauteed spinach came with big chunks of garlic.  I'm a real garlic lover, so I actually wanted an even stronger garlic taste from the spinach, but I couldn't complain about the tender texture.  I also tried the Oeuf Au Gratin, a deep dish of baked eggs that was a spoonful of richness.  Their coffee was excellent, and their orange juice was very good as well.  I'm recommending this breakfast to all my friends that are headed to Vegas.  Breakfast service ends at 10:30am I believe, which might be difficult for the night-owl party types in Sin City.
769	0	Ouch!  Really, this was painful.  Ate here for their Sunday Champagne Brunch.  First of all, they're serving J Roget for their champagne.  The stuff costs $4 a bottle so be ready for a headache if you're going all out on this stuff.  We did not as my wife and I both know better than to drink cheap champagne.  The buffet was weak in our opinion.  There is absolutely no ambiance to the place and it is grossly overpriced.  Thankfully we had a $65 credit as part of our room package so we only spent $10 with tip for the meal.  I would strongly suggest visiting the "Pantry" around the corner for breakfast or a different resort for their brunch.  If you do want a highlight to try out while you're there check out the cinnamon buns and the tiramisu, both were very good.
770	1	Waited 25 minutes to get seated here on a weekday night and had a pleasant experience. Though the seating was a bit cramped for a party of six, the food and service made up for it.  I ordered a rising sun burger which supposedly has kobe beef which is misleading. In America, wagyu is the equivalent of kobe. Despite that, the burger itself was quite good and larger than other gourmet burgers.   Service was also commendable. Our server was generous and accommodating but may have to work on her jokes.
771	0	I've been to Cravings Buffet a few times in the past for breakfast and never had a complaint.  This time my stay @ Mirage included a buffet,  so we tried the dinner buffet,  which I'm very sorry I did.  Worst dinner buffet I've experienced as far a food is concerned.  The roast beef was dry,  the corn beef was edible, which is the best I can say.  The other food, thumbs down.  I thought the fresh cooked pasta would be better, but it was not.  The creme brulee was more watery than it should've been.   Chocolate cake so-so.  Salad was ok, but there's no way to mess that up........ The only redeeming part of the meal was unlimited beer or wine.... Mirage really needs to improve on their buffet considering the last three I;ve visited at the MGM Grand, Bellagio & Aria were nice.
772	1	Peppermill ended up being the place that most surprised me in Vegas, I wasn't really sure what to expect but now I recommend this place to anyone I talk to who is planning a trip to Vegas.   We came during the afternoon brunch so my I don't have anything to say about the Fireside Lounge [except that I really want to try it out next time].   We came at a pretty random time, like 2 pm or something on a weekday and were quickly sat. The best way I can describe the interior is that it is like an old fashioned diner with a modern twist, it is colored blue, pink and purple! One thing I noticed is that it seemed well maintained and clean, unlike many old school diners and other places on the strip.   Service was prompt and friendly, checked on us the right amount of times while also letting us pig out in peace.   There were many many things I wanted to try on the menu but I opted for an omelet, it hit the spot and was a TON of tasty food. I definitely recommend this place for food after you have been walking the strip all day and have worked up an appetite. The price was more than reasonable for the amount of food you get and we all left stuffed and happy. We also left with a complimentary souvenir photo of our group - fun touch!   It is a fairly simple looking place from the outside during the day which could make it easy to miss, it is up on the northern part of the strip sorta near Circus Circus.   If you are looking for an affordable place to stuff your face in Vegas - definitely try the Peppermill!
773	0	Food = 4 Stars Service = 1 Star Location = 3 Stars because the patio was closed and this is where we originally wanted to sit  :(  I came here on a Sunday evening, It was PACKED! We had to give our IDs to the desk to get a table pager; which I found uncomfortable with. 20 minutes later, our party of 4 gets a nice booth in the back. The server was cute but seemed rushed. We gave her our cocktail order and it took about 10 minutes for her to bring them back. Most of the ice appeared melted already in my Margarita but it tasted Awesome even though the salt had all fallen off.   We placed our order for the apps and food and that was the last we saw our server for the night until paytime. The chips and Guacamole were awesome. I really enjoyed the salsa as well. My salad was rather boring, so I was going to ask the server to bring me some black beans or something to add to it, but sadly she never came back so I ate it how it was. Everyone else had mexican dishes and loved their dinners. The refried beans were really good.    I never was offered a water or cocktail refill :( I was freaking thirsty by the end of my meal!! My poor Bf tried the spicy sauce and had nothing to wash it down with by sour cream lol   We wait for what seemed like and endless time for the girl to bring the check after we had finished our meals. My bf wanted dessert, but it wasn't offered so we paid and left.   I would go back... But definitely not let her wait on me.
774	1	If you go please ask for Gary to be your waiter. Him and his serving staff were by far one of the best crews I've ever had the pleasure of dealing with in a fine dining restaurant. He was extremely helpful with the pronunciation of the food (as most of the menu headlines are in French)  and took the time to explain the finer points of what you were about to enjoy. Please tip well because him and the staff are very deserving of a top level Gratuity. Thank you Gary for a fine meal and a great dining experience. Defiantly will return.
775	1	On our way out of Vegas we stopped in for breakfast at Bouchon.  I had the french toast, it was truly the best I have ever had.  It was as beautiful as the picture in the cookbook I have been drooling over for months.  It lived up to all of my expectations.  The hubby had the daily steak and egg omelet special.  It was delish, the meat was tender, and the side of bacon was plentiful and yummy.  It was served with brioche with house-made jam which was wonderful.  I wish I had some to take home.  I can't wait to go back!
776	1	Was recommended this restaurant by my cousin.  My bf and I sat by the large window overlooking the garden outside. Really pretty view. The restaurant gives off the "I dont try too hard" vibe. It's cozy but not TOO cozy. It's classy but not too classy. It's somehow casual too... but not TOO casual. You get the pt. It lets its food speak for itself. I kinda like that sometimes. Anyway, Two things I remember from this place:  1. the bread which was DIVINEE! Flaky on the outside soft on the inside. Perfection! 2. the scallops. OMG.. BEST scallops ive had in my life and trust me I've had a lot of scallops. It just melted in my mouth. It was so tender, cooked perfectly. It was a well put together dish but honestly the scallops were so good they could have held their own.  Everything else was forgettable but I do remember they were delicious. I hardly remember our appetizers, our sides, or desserts. I think my bf's entree was the salmon but it sadly limped in the shadows of my scallop.
777	1	LOVE this place.  Not only is it in my favorite Las Vegas hotel, The Cosmopolitan - but it exhudes that feeling of farmhouse crossed with Americanized swagger.  Walking in to a big cow at the front entry - you KNOW there is going to be some serious beef/meat here.  The menu is full of extremely inviting options.... right from the start.  You sit down to popcorn out of a tin, while choosing what to drink.  How a person can NOT have a milshake is beyond me.  And no, not for dessert.. but to start :)  Whether bam boozled or regular you cannot go wrong.  Remember all bam boozled shakes you can get without the liquor mostly, for 3 bucks less.  So.... even if you don't want the alcohol OR are still drunk from the daily festivities Vegas has to offer... you MUST get a shake.  Tiramisu, Vanilla, Drunken Monkey, Birthday Cake... grasshopper... all YUM!    Next is to decide on the main.  The salads are huge.  Everything is really.  The burgers are large and so so fresh.  Meat piled high on a fresh bun... with so many tasty toppings.  The steakhouse burger is amazing... although I could stand a few less black peppercorns.  The classic burger is even an smooth choice.  If you want a mountain of meat on a bun, they have that too.  OR if you are looking for something without beef... I guess that option is also available.  I don't think there would be a bad option - and I love finding out :)  The fries are okay... the sweet potato fries are better..  You can watch TV while in there... you'll get great service... and you surely won't be disappointed.  And truly the prices aren't THAT extreme considering you're in The Cosmo on the Strip in Las Vegas!
778	0	Let's just get straight to the point...  Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing, but the ramen that they had there wasn't the finest I've had. It had me regretting my decision to get it and wanting the tan tan noodles that were next to me and the ceviche that was across the table. The broth was watery with some greasy in it. It was just too salty. I'll pass next time on the ramen and just get something....less complicated.
779	0	Clean and sterile like an operating room.....  Such a strange feeling to walk into Lee's Sandwiches, which is not quite a yogurt store, grocery store, or a sandwich shop, but some type of odd mixture.  There are overpriced "Imported from France" goods for sale on a few shelves throughout the store.  It's a random selection of cookies, teas, and other things you probably wouldn't buy when you're cruising for a sandwich.  The yogurt machines are on the wall, like you would see at a yogurt store, but I'm not sure about the topping selection; it looked sparse at best.   Now, onto the sandwiches.  The menu on the wall above the registers is big and colorful.  The pictures look exactly like the sandwiches do, which normally would be a great thing, but here it's a disappointment.  I went with the BBQ Pork sandwich.  These are in the style of Bhan Mi, but really subpar.  The bread is missing that great crisp you expect from a baguette.  The flavor of the sandwich was muted as well, and even biting into big slices of jalapenos and bunches of cilantro I couldn't really get into the sandwich.    There is now a $10 CC minimum if you plan on using plastic, but really, you're better off just going somewhere else.
780	1	I got offered over an hour wait at a restaurant upstairs, heard this spot was a nice place to grab a quick meal, but still has a 30+ minute wait. I wanted to at least get some cosmo experience, so I ponied up to the bar here. Despite the business, A Daisy Dukes put on a good show when it came to pouring my drinks and helping me with the menu. The 'BFG' as she put it=DANK. Lamb burgers are definitely my new flavor.
781	0	The place was so unorganized, and to be 'politically correct'....It's GHETTO! The employees, the food, the clientele...GHETTO! We were afraid just the parking lot alone, why they do not hire security! But, if you love your fried ochra, fried chicken, corn bread and ice tea....this might be "your joint"!....just don't for get to wear the bullet proof vest!.....
782	0	Here is all I can eat from the sky above to the sea beneath, but there is no character at all and the service is awful.  Having a great expectation, i came here on the first day of the MGM Grand staying to start off my trip to LV with fantastic meals even though i ve been frugal in an everyday life. Imagined that this buffet is great, i dressed up to fit on a high-end restaurant. Soon after getting in the restaurant, i regretted the way i wore. This restaurant is below than casual. My mom and i arrived around 6 o'clock  and there was no crazy line out there. However, the hostesses were very cold and my appetite had gone already and i didn't want to eat here. But my mom is too old to move to an another buffet place (because she was very excited to eat dinner at the buffet), i reluctantly fallowed her and had a seat.  The food is mediocre. There were many ethnic food like American, Asian, Greek, Spanish. However, every food was not delicious at all. Even as a Asian, i tasted the Chinese food and it was a disappointing. The feature is almost there but the taste was no character. This was not well made. Supposed by everyone, Chinese food made by Chinese chef, Mexican food made by Mexican chef. the desserts made by patisserie. All taste were the same mediocre.   Everything made out of cheap. For example, the crab legs, these were too thin and nothing left inside the shell and very salty.   Even though i have been so many buffets out there like Aria, Caesar Place... this experience was the worst.
783	1	What a fantastic place this is!!! I'm not just saying this as a HUGE fan of Gordon Ramsay, but I'm saying this as a burger monster!! My husband and I woke up after a late night in vegas, just to go stand in line to get a taste of Burgr and it was worth all of it!!! We started off with the roasted jalapeno poppers, which were served in individual little shot glasses with the sauce at the bottom. They were delicious. Definitely one of the best I've tasted. My husband ordered a cocktail, while I decided to go with the Shakes - Shake #1 which was a chocolate shake with caramel pudding (yes pudding!)... We ordered the uber cheese burger and the southern yardbird burger with a side of truffle parmesan fries. The burgers were cooked to perfection. The staff was friendly, efficient and helpful. All in all a five star experience and I will definitely go back there!
784	1	When we're in Vegas, we stay in the Venetian 90% of the time.  Having the restaurant right near our elevator is a plus, just a short walk and you'll get some great food.  My wife and I already enjoy The Cheesecake Factor, so with this being a sister company, I was sure we'd love it (and we did).  During our last visit a few months ago, where we stayed for 4 days, we at there at least once a day.  We ordered pizza, steak, italian, burgers and always had a very enjoyable meal.  The staff has always been helpful and friendly and we'll be going back again and again during each future visit!
785	1	I found it!  Best/worst idea ever was using my friends review for help, even though he gave an important clue, I was sent to the wrong floor, doh!   I ordered the white cheese pizza slice, and my  wife ordered the mushroom slice.  Delicious cheese with feta and garlic that melted in my mouth on every bite.  The mushrooms on my wife's slice were very fresh; she added red pepper and parmesan cheese to complete her pizza bliss.  Pizza is thin and pretty decent size; with the cost of 5 dollars a slice or 25 for a whole pie(16 slices), this eatery is a broke drunkards dream.  We will definitely  be back for a whole pie to take on the road home, or have for dinner if we lost our butt at the tables.    If you're in the Cosmopolitan casino leave there and go to the mall area.  From there go to the third floor and find a pool table.  You should see a hallway with vintage albums as wall art.  Follow it down, order and enjoy your victorious slice!
786	0	I was dragged here for my sisters going away party...that being said it pretty much matched my low expectations and then some.  This place is absolutely disgusting. The dining area is gross, messy and kids were running wild. The plates and silverware were dirty and sticky. The food made me sick. This place deserves no stars.
787	0	This place used to be pretty decent but we had the worst experience here this week. We got stuck in the West wing and our room was awful. I've stayed in better low end hotels like Motel 6 before. We were on the 5th floor and there has literally been a plate of room service waste sitting outside the elevators for the last 4 days! We will never stay here again!
788	0	I recently visited Golden corral 2641 in Las Vegas Nevada for breakfast with Dad.The place was nice and clean however the  customer service was horrible. I was ignored several minutes while standing at the  omelette station by the employee  Eva that was in charge of it . The Manager (Tomas) was also behind the counter  so I asked him, did they make fresh eggs? He replied yes, so I stood there waiting patiently for Eva to ask me what I would like . The entire time of me standing there, she never looked up and gave me any eye contact even after me trying to say good morning and addressing her by name. The next thing I know another employee whom I assume was on their lunch break walked up to the counter. She immediately acknowledged him, start speaking in Spanish and started making  his omelette. Still giving her the benefit of the doubt. I thought maybe she didn't see me so I stood directly beside him. She completed his omelette gave it to him and turned around and walked away.  At this point I realize I was being blatantly ignored, so I turned to look for the manager that I initially saw behind the counter. Before I could say one word  planning just to ask him if Eva spoke English he goes into a rant saying "we're working here ,working here" This is a new promotion...I guess referring to the omelette station that I didn't had no idea was new or old . I was in such shock the next thing he said to me was so what kind of eggs do you want? At that point my appetite was ruined I felt disrespected. I looked for my dad who was just about to sit down to eat his food and told him to leave it. Then asked the manager immediately for refund. After realizing his mistake he tried to apologize but was too late. I then name and he just gave me a card with no response I asked his name again and then he blurted out "Tomas" this is no was to handle A Dissatisfied customer. The problem would've easily been resolved had he said the station was not open, when I asked him did they make fresh eggs. Eva or Tomas could've simply said the station wasn't ready.
789	0	If YOU Don't have a SEVEN STARS or a DIAMOND CARD. Expect a Very Long Wait..!! They DO NOT Cater and are NOT Welcoming to People who are trying the Establishment for the First Time. LUCY, who I believe might be the manager (hostess) kept telling us different things. We were a party of 12. One minute we have a Table and next minute, We DON'T..!! Our Tables were taken by a Seven Stars or Diamond Card Holder..  THE FOOD WAS NOT WORTH IT..!!!!! The Wait or the Lies Left a Bad Taste in My Mouth..!!  I Don't Think I Will Be Coming Back... :(
790	0	Very crowded (you couldn't really dance or get around)  Music sucked it would have slight pauses and weird mixture of music. Drinks where watered down. Saw a lot of people having issues getting out of there ( too drunk to go down the stairs) Oh and it was super hot in there!!  It was nasty.
791	1	Found another bomb breakfast place in Vegas!! this place is on the Zagat list so that's why it gets a lot of ppl there every morning!! we ordered the steak benedict n the corned beef. Let me tell u this... the steak benedict was sooo good lots of steak in it so I was really full after! but the corned beef was even better!! My gf ordered that one wanna swtich with her hahah kinda far from the strip but its worth the drive tho!!
792	0	Came here for lunch. It's around $20/person. After taxes my family of 3 paid almost $70 and it was definitely not worth it. There was barely anything appetizing to eat, the variety is very limited. There is a lot of bread, a lot of cold salad, a small asian and italian station (very limited and unappealing). The food is not that hot and the taste was meh. The dessert and drinks section is decent. The staff is very attentive to clearing your dishes- which is the only reason why I gave this 2 rating instead of 1. I noticed a lot of other people left very quickly. Anyways it's so expensive and not worth it, trust me! At the very least go in and take a look before you pay.
793	1	Great food. Great prices (for the strip). Line was long, but moved fast. We had to wait for a seat, but eventually we got one before food was available for pickup. We went around 8:30 pm on Sunday night (Labor Day weekend). Wife and I shared Shack Stack burger and cheese fries. We had complementary water. Burger was really great. Portobello was loaded with cheese and popped when cut in half. Meat was cooked just right. Wife did not like cheese on her fries; I did. I am happy that Shack Shack is coming to Downtown Summerlin.
794	0	I would like to know if the food or service is good... I will never know.  My sons wanted chicken wings... Figured we would call ahead to see what the seating situation was like... No answer.  Looked up phone numbers for restaurant.  No answer over 2 hour period of calling at least 6 times.  Called main desk.  They asked extensive questions on when we would come, how many... I was getting tired of this and said, "I'll just place an order for carry-out."  "One moment please.  I will transfer you to the restaurant."  Still no answer.   It must be nice that business is so good on a Sunday that you cannot even pick up the phone.  I guess you don't need my money anyway.
795	1	I love love this place.  This is must go to whenever Im in Vegas. I have had the Kiki burger and bahn mi burger. I got them protein style.  They were both delicious and fresh.  Their sweet potato fries and sauce it comes with is really good too. I cant wait til they open up in Santa Monica!
796	1	I'm from Los Angeles and there is no breakfast place like this. I highly recommend it. The breakfast dishes are very creative and mighty tasty. There is a huge variety of food to choose from.   If you are able, ask to be served by Brady. He was a great server with a good sense of humor. He will make you feel like a welcomed guest.
797	0	So I was in Vegas over Thanksgiving week and we were going to go to the Bellagio buffet on Thanksgiving day. There was a 3 hr wait. We decided to go to the MGM buffet being that we were going to the David Copperfield show at the MGM that night. There was no wait....... For a reason. It was well below average. I thought it was a level above Sizzler. I don't expect much from Sizzler but I do expect more out of a huge hotel like MGM. Food was dry, bad low end choices. It has variety but quality lacks. The weirdest thing is that all the meats were scattered everywhere. Most buffets I've been to have stuff grouped together accordingly... Not this buffet! The buffet was $40 but should have been $20. It you're not worried about quality, this buffet is for you. You probably have a better dessert choice at home.
798	1	I loved this place. There was a 45 minute wait, but well worth it. I ate the pork stew off the northern menu. It was delicious. The place was busy, clean and the staff were very attentive. No surprise some of my favorite food network chefs had their pictures on the wall. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas
799	1	Like Johnny Cash, I've been everywhere, man.  I've had PIZZA everywhere, man.  And Secret Pizza is, hands-down, the best pizza I've had ANYWHERE.  A few days ago, my fianc and I got into a random conversation about what we would want to eat for a last meal if we found ourselves on Death Row.  Both of us were kind of stumped.  Now we know.  SECRET PIZZA.  In fact, if Secret Pizza was ONLY served on Death Row, I would commit atrocities against society to get my slice.  I would.  Finding the place was kind of fun.  I had an idea of where it might be based on other Yelp reviews, but I found myself tugging on door handles that do not open and trying to push on panes of glass that looked loose.  I guess I expected it to be so secret that I would have to prove my worth in death-defying feats of strength or manifest the entrance with the power of my mind.  Oh I figured it out alright, but not before I made a total ass of my dorky self in front of lots of scantily-clad club-goers.  My fianc started freaking out first.  For him, it was love at first ooey-gooey sight.  I heard nearby diners launching expletive-laced raves about how it was the best "mo-effin' pizza ever."  Yet, until I took that first bite, I didn't believe.  Now I have seen the light... I have come to Pizza Jesus.  During the entire consumption of my portion of our pie (pepperoni, sausage, and pepperoncini), I giggled like I did on my first date with my fianc.  It was so good that I found it almost hilarious, especially since I just now found this place and I'M MOVING AWAY IN JUNE.  Oh, the cruel, cruel irony.  It's a cold world indeed.  We had plenty of leftovers.  On the way to the car with our ginormous pizza box, my fianc and I argued over how I was apparently "mothering him" by making him hold our precious treasure with two hands.  Maybe he has a point - maybe I need to have a baby to detract from my abnormal attachment to inanimate objects (like pizza).  But I digress.  Oh, and we had to remove a shelf in our fridge to make the box fit.  I'm not even sure it was meant to be removed.  I actually think it's broken now.  Oh well.  It's worth sacrificing the security deposit on our apartment to preserve the pristine state of our perfect pizza.  EDIT:  FYI, the REAL secret of Secret Pizza is that you really need to order the whole pizza so it is fresh and hot.  It isn't nearly as good if you just buy whatever slice is hanging around.  Take my word for it.  Buying the whole pie and having it piping hot takes this pizza from around 3 stars to 5.
800	0	On our recent trip to Vegas, my mother and I came here because of a rave review by some people we met on the trip. My mom wanted Chinese and I wanted Mexican, so the restaurant seemed perfect.  The prices were shocking ($5 per taco? seriously?) so we ended up sharing the chips & salsa, Mongolian beef, and 20 vegetable fried rice. The food was delicious, but the prices are outrageous. It was $32 for the beef (which was basically a glorified salad). It was a delicious strip steak, but tiny, we were expecting more. The fried rice was delicious but not worth $20. Plus, the amount of food we were given did not satisfy us. When we arrived my mother was starving, and she left unsatisfied so we ended up having a second (tiny) dinner at Serendipity 3. Next time I want Mexican in Vegas, I'll go to Yolos in Planet Hollywood.
801	1	AWESOME find.  One of those,  how did we get there? Im so glad we found this place, kind of experiences for my group of 4.  Service was great- our waiter was funny, attentive and CRAZY fast.  We shared a few plates including the shishito peppers, octopus balls (not the best but not bad), onion rings ( AMAZING, we should have ordered 4 orders instead of 1) and we each got a noodle bowl or a burger for our mains.  Broth was delish of my noodles and the noodles were good, but the chewier ramen from the dish with the XO sauce had better texture.  Pork belly pieces were like bits of porky heaven- honestly it was very memorable and delicious.  Cannot stress enough how good the onion rings were.  As a bit of a onion ring connoisseur I have to say they rank at the top of my lifetime list, and they were incredible inexpensive.  MUST GO BACK!  You need to go and try this place out, now :)
802	1	his place has redeemed itself.   I was lucky to be seated right away since I was there all alone. My waitress Amanda was there immediately to see if I had any questions and to take my drink order. She has a warm smile and made me feel very welcome. I ordered the Texas toast French toast with eggs and bacon. It was delicious. I also ordered a side of toast for which she asked if I wanted it buttered which usually they don't so that was great. The eggs were perfectly over medium and they were actually seasoned. Amanda was very attentive and was sure that I was not in need of anything. I also had the banana nut muffin it was one of the best I've had in a restaurant, I am a bit partial to my own.  I will say the service through out was exceptional from the moment I walked in until I left even thought the register had trouble reading the card I had.   The food would definitely be worth the wait, and the service I experienced was above expectations for how busy the are. Give it a try if you haven't been
803	0	I had previously stayed at this hotel when it was the Las Vegas Hilton... at that time they were going through a renovation and apparently also changing the name... This was like 3-5 years ago.. Sadly, since then nothing has changed.  The one thing I remember that I did not like were the long long lines and wait times for the elevator.  There are two problems, there are not enough elevators and also they are not dedicated to lets say for example 1-20 floor and then another set of elevators for 30-40 floors.  When checking in, I opted to upgrade the room for $20... and was amazed that they called it 'an upgraded room'.  According to travelocity, this is a 4 star hotel... this room was more like a 2 star, so I can just imagine what the regular room looked like.  The room itself, the tub spout was coming off of the wall, it was leaking water and the tub didn't have a light... The ac/heater thermostat was not digital... and the door key/knob stopped reading cards... I was hard pressed to find any renovations to this room.
804	0	Girls hold on to your pocket purses. This is the 2nd time I've been here and a girl I'm with has had something stolen from them. Whether it be a phone or a credit card. Security did nothing, the hell can they do besides stand there and look "pretty"? Nice area but I wouldn't call it safe regardless of how many dudes you see with suits. They're there for show. Maybe they're letting too many shady dudes in for free on slow nights. And in case you're wondering, these were straight pick-pocketing cases. I wouldn't call it negligence. Thank you Vegas, I guess I'm just a small percentage of your shitty cases. Anthony Delgado the "manager" and Jeff shepherd did nothing to help the situation but blame us.
805	1	The wife and I came here for lunch and we were very impressed! The restaurant had a hip, stylish vibe with the fire decor in the front. Great menu with plenty of more-than-basic options to choose from. I ordered the fish and chips sandwich which was great! She ordered a jalapeo burger and truffle fries which were amazing as well. Only down fall was the two drunk idiots that sat down at our table and started making out.... WTH JUST HAPPENED! The waitress asked if they were with us and quickly got them out HAHA maybe have a railing around the outside table so no one thinks that there's open seating??? Other than the drunken stupidity, I loved every bit of it and definitely recommend going!
806	0	2 1/2 stars.  The good: I was here for a convention, so the hotel being so close to the action was a plus. The monorail station out back is tremendously convenient, and the room I had (1520) was spacious and had a great view of a nearby golf course, the Stratosphere, and Fremont Street off in the distance.  The bad: It's so far removed from the hustle and bustle of the Strip. The monorail becomes your best friend if you stay here. The lack of electrical outlets in the room is an issue, there were what appeared to be cigarette burns in the rug by the closet, and the bath had a drip I couldn't quite stop. Also, I do gamble a bit, and whenever I walked by, the casino floor looked DEAD.  We were only here for a night. It did the job, and there were some positives to note. That said, I probably wouldn't stay here again unless it was for another convention.
807	1	I've been looking forward to coming back here since the first time I was here. Brought 5 other people with and strongly urged them not to order the Chicken n Waffles as I had to have them again, but wanted to see (taste) some other offerings lol.   As others have indicated the portions are HUGE! Many doggie bags were assembled last night.   Chicken n waffles are excellent! (Chicken is bone in). The waffles have big pieces of bacon inside!  The fu fu looking Kiwi watermelon lemonade is delicious. (I went with the adult version -a shot of vodka)  Round the table there was meatloaf pasta - delicious...the hammered pork loin - Amazing!....the stuffed meatloaf -awesome!...and finally the breakfast crab cakes ...best crab cakes I've tasted!    After our order was taken a plate of huge glazed biscuits arrived with a delicious peach preserve and honey butter.    I'm here for a couple more days, I be back for breakfast later and then await my next trip to start working my way thru the balance of the menu.   Great service, delicious food, priced right, huge portions...do it!
808	1	I ate here with my family.   Apps: We shared the chicken lime mango salad and buffalo chicken rolls. Both were amazing! Portions were huge.  Entrees: for my entree i had the pasta telephono which was good. But the gnocchi were AMAZING! Possibly the best pasta dish I have ever had.   Service: Our waitress was very nice and informative even suggesting menu items that turned out to be fantastic!  OVERALL: food- 4.5 service- 5 total- 4.75 rounds up! (QUICK, RELATIVELY CHEAP, GOOD SERVICE AND EXCELLENT FOOD)
809	1	My wife and I got married in Vegas last week, and I wanted to celebrate by going out to Bouchon. I've always wanted to dine at one of Chef Keller's restaurants, and if ever there was a perfect opportunity, this was it.   I made reservations a few weeks prior, and told them about the wedding. When we arrived, they immediately congratulated us on our marriage, which made us feel very special. Even our server congratulated us. Very classy.   We enjoyed foie gras, which was amazing. Dinner was great, and our server made a great recommendation on wine pairing.   Service was par excellance. Efficient, attentive but never over-bearing.   They even comped our dessert, which was an incredible pastry.   For the money they charge, my expectations were quite high. The staff not only met, but exceeded my expectations by miles.   I hope we have the opportunity to return. Chef Keller and his staff are truly the best at what they do.
810	0	The service is so horrendous it's laughable. The food is mediocre at best. Came in with a party of 7. The place was busy, but not insane. I ordered a skinny margarita. Not bad. After I got my drink I had decent expectations. Table got guac and chips. Not very good albeit expensive. My chicken quesadilla was greasy and tasted like canned chicken. My boyfriend got fish tacos, and they were a little better, but bland.  Our server was basically non-existent. My friend had to ask three different ppl for a lemon for her water. The food runner brought her some, after a ridiculous wait for our food. We would have ordered more cocktails, however we didn't get the opportunity to.  Don't even bother. This is Vegas. There are much better restaurants. My wallet hurts from the price gouge.
811	1	If I could eat their Fried Chicken Benedict ever day I would.  It was incredible.  Loads of fried chicken, eggs, mashed potatoes, and biscuits were piled on this plate and covered with the most amazing sauce.  It is easily large enough for 2 average people to share (Or one really really hungry person to attempt).  This thing was a monster.  I was starving when i went in, and I love to eat.  I consider it one of my greatest skills.  This plate of food was too much for even me to handle (but it was so good I kept eating until I hated myself).    The restaurant itself was nice and the bar area where we ate was pretty quite.  Definitely will be back the next time I am in Vegas.
812	1	Move. the. hell. over, Earl of Sandwich. I found a new late-night lover and it's NY style pizza in Vegas.   My girlfriend raved about this place, while I rolled my eyes and insisted we go to Earl instead. She convinced me and we walked on over after a long night at the Marquee (both conveniently located in the Cosmo) and we were all speechless after our first bite.   We ordered a combo of white cheese, sausage, pepperoni, and mushrooms. I've never been a HUGE fan of pizza, but this thin, wide slice was simple and flawless.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=3cIZSbjXqJxr59N_84xHKQ  Do you remember when Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael (TMNT) ended their adventure by tearing down a slice of ooey gooey cheese pizza?   WE FELT EXACTLY LIKE THAT (or at least I did).
813	0	I wish I can give zero star if I can. The cashier & staffs were so rude, no willing to work there. The male manager who were working at when we were there, he wasn't willing to listen my complaint.   Here is the story.   I just came here at buffet and i spoke to one of their lady to ask how busy and what's their holiday pricing (usually pricing is different during the holiday). She seemed nice and she said 28.99 + tax. So I didn't buy the discount coupon from tix4tonight. And then I came here and they said pricing is 36.99. And they blamed me that I should remember the lady's name. Do you usually remember the person's name even if you want to ask the general question? Such Hours and pricing? If the manager knows how to treat customers, or manage his employees, they should give us the rate that she mentioned. I wasnt happy that he treated me and my family like this.
814	1	Best breakfast buffet for the money on the strip. For $18.95 you get unlimited omelette station, waffles that are so fluffy you think you are in heaven, bacon, sausage, hash browns, fruit, cold and hot cereal. A must if you like breakfast.  #bestwafflesever!

The pool is a hole in the ground full of dirty water. and.. I was not surprised when I noticed the giant cum stain on the couch cushion. If you are a dirty old man then this is the place or you!!!!!
816	1	YUMMMMOOOO. After clubbing at Marquee at 2am, you will be so tired and hungry! but luckily there is this random pizzeria down some random hallway! There is a long line, but its worth the wait because the pizza is sooo damn good! The pizza reminds me a of a new york pizza. Its big, thing and the crust is super crispy. Its about 3-4 dollars a slice and my oh my it is totally worth EVERY Penny! I got the pepperoni and meatball pizza, and a peppericni, bell pepper, and turkey?? slice. They were all delicious! And on top of that, I was short 50 cents on cash and the guy was nice enough to just give me the two slices for 9 dollars. THat is really good customer service :)
817	1	What a little gem! We ate lunch here before heading back home on a Monday afternoon. We arrived just as they opened at 11:30AM, and the place filled up very quickly. It was packed and there was a line by the time we left.   We ordered the Nam-Prik-Ong, as recommended by Ming Tsai and based on the reviews, as well as the crispy duck over Panang curry. We had the coconut ice cream over sticky rice for dessert. The food was absolutely amazing!   The Nam-Prik-Ong was the perfect blend of spices - savory with a warm spice. It comes with an assortment of things to dip (cucumber, cabbage, green beans, broccoli, cauliflower, fried pork rinds), and you can order a side of sticky rice to go with it. It's a perfect little appetizer.   The crispy duck over Panang curry was the best crispy duck and Panang curry (separately) I have ever had. The duck is pan fried and has a tasty crisp on the outside and is tender and moist (without tasting fatty) on the inside. It wasn't gamey and tasted better than any chicken I've ever eaten. The curry was deliciously made with just the right amount of creaminess and spiciness.   For dessert, we shared the coconut ice cream over sticky rice. The ice cream wasn't too sweet or overly coconut-y. The sticky rice was warm and "marinated" in a coconut milk mixture that gave it the tiniest bit of saltiness that complemented the ice cream beautifully.   We went for lunch and there was a buffet for $9.99 per person. We decided to eat off of the normal menu because we wanted to experience what all the hype was about. We ended up spending a lot more between the two of us, but it was well worth it.   The only thing I wish could've been different is the quantity of food. Although we were full at the end of the meal, it was so yummy that we wanted a few bites more. But that's probably just us being gluttonous.
818	0	No wonder Tix4Tonite were pawning these tickets to us.  Bad.  Hubs and I came by Tix4Tonite to see what show tickets we could grab for the night scored on Zumanity tickets at 70% off.  Awesome.  They also told us about dining options which we figured, what the hell? How bad could it be?  We spent $19/each and got our vouchers for Pampas.  The food is descent.  But hella slow! Jeez people, this is a churrascuria.  You are supposed to walk around with yummy meats and slice them onto my plate!  WTF? Everyone was cleaning and shit.  I want my meat!!!  We saw maybe 3 guys walking around with meats the whole hour and a half we were there.    Never again.
819	1	Midwest size portions meets Las Vegas excess.  Or maybe brunch on steroids?  This place came highly recommended and it did not disappoint.  Located away from the hordes of the visitors milling about the strip, this place is so popular that there is usually a 45 minute to 60 minute wait just to get seated.   Thankfully there were several of us so many dishes were sampled.  I ended up with the chicken and waffles which were excellent.   The chicken was perfectly fried up, not soggy or greasy.  The waffles were stuffed with bacon of all things!  Genius!  I also got to sample the hand hammered pork cutlet covered in some type of sage cream gravy which was pretty fantastic.  The portions are ludicrous.  I felt like we were in an episode of the Flintstones.  Huge portions and reasonable prices.  Most entrees ran about $15 but the quality and portion size made it pretty reasonable.  Not to mention that most buffets on the strip are much pricier with hit or miss quality.  Seriously, those of you with normal sized appetites might consider splitting some of the larger entrees they are so huge.
820	1	Since we were a bit pressed for time, we ate in the bar which serves the entire menu.  My group of 5 each ordered different burgers and everyone tried them all - ultimately everyone thinking their burger was the best LOL.  But really, mine was the best - I got the Asian burger (don't remember name)...it was divine.  Fries and rings are great.  Grown up milkshakes were awesome.  Definitely coming here again!
821	1	BEST BURGER I HAD IN A LONG TIME :)   5 stars: *prompt seating *great customer service -- our waitress kept coming back to check up on us and kept refilling our drinks without me requesting for a refill. i love that! *The meat wasn't dry! *A creative way to dress up your burger  I will call my burger "The Morning Beast burger" (don't laugh because it was GOOD) *Turkey burger *Dry whole wheat bun *Blue Cheese *Caramelized Onions *FRIED EGG!!  It was really good! The turkey burger wasn't dry at all! i know in the past  turkey burgers tend to get dry due to lack of fat but it was grill to perfection.  PS. Try the Sweet Potato fries! :)   Total bill for two people was wound $40 with drinks so it wasn't THAT bad. I rather spend a lot of money on good food :)  Have anyone tried the Truffles?! $35 each?!!
822	0	Not worth the price after having been to the Carnival World Buffet at the Rio Hotel & Casino.  This buffet was (key word, "was") rated the #1 buffet in Vegas but since the rating, there have been a whole group of buffets that have outdone this place.  This restaurant is mediocre at best.  Also, service is very spotty.  Once you go Carnival World Buffet, you don't go back!
823	0	DONT waste your money.  Inferior beef, inferior service wilted warm salad and zero appeal. What a huge disappointment. The food was TERRIBLE!  The first order was prime rib. It was served swimming in water from the unseasoned frozen vegetables and had absiolutely no flavor. That was exchanged for a piece of meat named as a fillet of beef on the menu. It was the most inferior fillet ever served   YUK! Our guest ordered a medium rare New York strip.  It was served well done. Our guest was too polite to complain. My husbands bone in rib eye was a tasteless overcooked disaster.  The only edible thing on the table was the cotton  candy.  What a sad experience. I came home and made a fried egg sandwich as I was so hungry. Not worth going  to even for the view.  Zero stars.
824	0	First of all the prices are way too high, I ordered the Chinese taco, the oyster used on it (one only) was either canned, or long past due. The rest was greasy and odd tasting.  The potatoes with mole where French fries with sweet mole.  And the lamb potstickers were still raw in the middle, the cumin doily they cooked with it knocked out ANY lamb flavor.   What a shame, the concept was good, the execution crappy.
825	1	Stopped here on our way to the airport. It was the best food we had all week! Considering we had paid $125 each for one mediocre meal, getting great food here for $25 for the both of us was awesome. We started with the tuna kimbap and both had the spicy ramen. The Kimbap was outstanding and the ramen was perfect. And the dried squid!!!! Amazing
826	1	This place was expensive by normal standards, although for Vegas standards, not so much. I had a regular burger, which I thought would just be average but was AMAZING. I also had one of their adult milkshakes.... OH MY GOSH it was so good and barely tasted like alcohol. I wanted to go back here the next night for dinner. That's how good it was. A must go to in Vegas.
827	0	I *really* wanted to like this place more, considering it's HUGE and there seems to be so much variety on the menu. The yogurt area was the first thing that caught my eye, but was surprised to know there really wasn't as many toppings to be expected (if even at all). It's open 24 hours, and the entire place looks like a gigantic cafeteria. Bright lighting, plenty of seating. The night I came in with my friends the place was nearly empty, so no issues with finding a spot.   We had the cream puffs and the sugar cane drink. Cream puffs lacked taste, as I felt like the cream in the middle really wasn't anything significant or tasty (the cream was just "there"). I do have to say the sugar cane drink is worth giving a go, since it's sweet but not overly sweet to where you get sick of it halfway. Otherwise the pastries and the bite of the sandwich my friend got wasn't anything special. Also, I always seem to think places who just offer cash as a paying method is behind with everything else technologically in the world unless it's a family business. Hopefully the next time I go the experience will be different.
828	1	Someone told us (my boyfriend and I) to find the Secret Pizza joint at the Cosmopolitan, and that we would LOVE it. And, after 30 minutes of searching for this place, we feel in LOVE with this place! (the alcohol might have helped)   I encourage everyone to adventure/trek/ search for this place. And when you find the place, order the White Pie Pizza - it's to die for!! Yummy yummy in my tummy. We also suggested this "pizza place" to our friend's parents who are of Sicilian decent, and they stated that the white pie pizza reminds them of their family made pizza from Sicily.
829	0	I have been to this location many times and, as usual, it disappointed me again. I always hope that things will change but they don't. The Founders Sirloin Filet that they advertise is extremely fatty and very tough to chew. The Garlic Marinated Sirloin is rationed. If you want more than one piece you need to make a second trip to get it. Apparently the employees can only give you one piece at a time. A lot of the dishes were not at the proper temperature (not hot enough). The service is terrible. When I pointed out a problem to one of the management team I was told "Don't worry about it" as if this person could not be bothered. I drove quite a distance to eat here because it's the only Golden Corral in Las Vegas. No more. I'm not going to waste precious gas to be disappointed and treated like crap. I'd rather eat at Burger King.
830	0	The name says it all. THIS should be your last resort.  We walked by this restaurant many times before deciding to go, it looked like a load of fun, the food was okay, not the greatest.   The biggest problem I had with this restaurant was the server, yes I know that you're supposed to get sarcastic service here and he was mouthy, which was great. But aside from being pretty much ignored most the time, even though he pretty much just wandered around most the time.   Near the end of our meal these two girls came in he sat there at the bar talking to them, he completely ignored us after that and he also had another large table of probably seven people, they had to bug him for their bill.   The second problem I had with this was the drinks, I bought the large margarita in the souvenir glass and yes I did order the extra shot, it came out so strong I couldn't drink it. My husband did but I did bring it up to the server that it was incredibly strong and bitter, not complaining mind you just to let them know and all he said was well he ordered the extra shot didn't you?  So all in all, this was not a very good meal save yourself some money and go else where. we wish we would have
831	1	Can be tricky to find if you don't know Vegas really well, since it's in the walkway *between* Mandalay Bay and the Luxor. It's worth it. Follow your nose to the Lush bath products store across the hall.  On its face, it seems pretty straightforward: decent bar, burger joint, TVs in the booths showing some sport or other. It goes deeper. Start with the beer list - great selection, large draft list and truly wonderful bottle list. I've had award winning Canadian beers here that I can't even get in Canada. If you've never had a Unibroue beer from Quebec, I recommend the Unibroue 17.  The menu, too, goes deeper. Not just burgers. Grain fed or naturally raised beef? Wagyu, maybe? You are spoiled for choice, but if that intimidates, they have several reasonable pre-defined burgers to choose from or riff on.  I'm the guy who brought Melissa Y. (below) here on her birthday, making lots of noise about the $60 burger. Kobe beef, foie gras, 1/3oz of shaved black truffle on an onion roll. The Rossini, they call it. We each had one, and they were great. Better than great - putting black truffle on a burger is something I haven't done before or since (except on return trips here) and it is some inspired eats, my friend. You would not do badly to spend some blackjack winnings on that little masterpiece.  BUT. I'm going to tell you something important here, so listen good: you can do better. You can make a thing more pure and more perfect. You can reach the Platonic ideal of burger in this place, and reaching Platonic ideals isn't a thing we get to do very often in our lives. Are you ready? Then let's begin.  Ditch the foie - it adds richness where none is required, and the richness it adds is lost in the strong flavours. Ditch the kobe, too. Kobe is either getting you beautiful texture (not irrelevant in ground meat, but certainly *less* so than with steak cuts) or beautiful flavour, but the naturally raised beef has that in spades. Ditch the onion bun as well, if you want my opinion. I like onions plenty, but baked into a roll they lose some of their fire and even if the result is still tasty, you're missing the opportunity to go for their Ciabatta (great texture, nice yeasty flavour, works with the beer) or their Sesame (a classic, done well).  Okay, so now: Keep the black truffles (KEEP THE BLACK TRUFFLES), but maybe get your cheese on, and add some pepper bacon or a fried egg. Congratulations, champ, you've got yourself a burger that adds no pretense, that gilds no lilies, but which explodes with flavour you didn't think a burger could have. This is it, this is the burger you've been waiting for.  I'm proud of you, soldier.
832	0	Prices are low here and the Indian restaurant in the food court is good. The bed was  comfortable but the lobby and common areas need updating badly.  It seemed pretty dark and dingy even during the day.  It is pretty far from the main attractions on the strip.
833	1	Going into my dinner here at Shake Shack, I never thought anything would come close to my love for In N' Out Burger. Much to my surprise, Shake Shack came close and even surpassed In N' Out in several ways!  Service: Sorry, but In N' Out wins for service. When we arrived at Shake Shack there was a very long line, which wasn't a problem because it gave us time to discuss the menu (prominently displayed on a large wall right when you walk in). The line moved fast and soon enough it was our turn; however, the woman who took our order was ornery and short with us. B-  Decor: I LOVED the ambience and decor in Shake Shack. We snagged a spot on the large bar table in the center of the restaurant (shared by up to fifteen diners) and had a great view over the open kitchen and large flat screen TVs. I noticed couches, tables, and benches all throughout Shake Shack. A+  Food: We waited about 8-10 minutes for our food (as expected, given the large amount of people). It was well worth the wait! The burger patties were absolutely DIVINE. If you are looking for fresh and juicy, order the Shack Burger. I can't say enough good things about the patties. The only problem I had was that I asked for a lettuce-wrapped burger, and instead I got a patty on top of a slice of lettuce (making for quite a messy meal). In N' Out wins for food presentation and sauce but as much as it pains me to say it, Shake Shack has the better patty. A+  For three burgers (with added bacon), a side of fries, and a mango lemonade, it came to about $25.   Shake Shack definitely deserves the five stars.
834	0	My bf & I decided to attend this club because they offered the cheapest cover charge... bad mistake. We arrived fairly early, probably around 10:30 PM and there was already a line. Luckily for us, we were on the guest list and got in pretty quickly. The entrance to the club was weird. We had to go up a few flights of stairs (& this is a hard task for me since I was wearing heels!). When we got to the dance floor, it was pretty open and we had plenty of space. I swear, once 11:30 PM rolled around, it became SO packed. My bf & I could hardly dance. The majority of the time was spent outside. There were a couple of times I needed to use the restroom but once I saw that the ladies had to go UP another flight of stairs PLUS the wait of the line, I decided that my bladder will have to suffer a little.   The DJ played great dancing music & the crowd was live; however, I think I could've enjoyed myself at a different club where it was LESS packed and I could actually dance. The drink prices were ridiculously high but I guess I can't really complain about that since we were in Vegas.
835	1	I've been here several times and everything here is always perfect. From the wait service to the quality of the food. The butter here is simply amazing.   I ordered the Boudin Blanc while my husband ordered the chicken and waffler. My goodness, that is the juicest, perfectly seasoned roast chicken I think I've ever had in my life!!. I totally wasn't expecting it and I found myself eating off my husband's dish. The boudin blanc is tasty as well since I've had it before, it's a good dish to get over and over.   This time i ordered a side of Lyonnaise potatoes. Potatoes were good, but with all the other food I was eating already, i barely finished that.   I'm definitely a fan of Bouchon since this is my must stop brunch place whenever I am in Vegas. Next time I really want to try the beignets!!
836	1	I don't know if anyone could ever convince me to re-review a restaurant, my first impression is typically good enough for me, and should be for everyone else. Even if you argue that I went to a location on an 'off day' I could really care less, if you are a professional and have opened a restaurant, there should be no such thing as an off day. I will however, go back to a place just for the pure enjoyment if it is good enough. Such is the case with Bachi Burger. I went many months ago, it's been one of the best burgers I've had in Vegas to date and I've had many people ask to go there with me. I've been twice in the last two weeks, and I'm not sure if I'm glad I went back.  Since my first visit, they have finally added a few permanent, lit signs to the outside of the building so its presence is a little more noticeable. The dcor hasn't changed at all, with simple loose tables and chairs, plain white walls, and some Asian-inspired photos for sale. I went once for dinner in the middle of the week, and the other day again for lunch. Both times I was able to sit right away unlike the first time, but that's about where the consistency stops. The night I went for dinner it was fairly busy, but our waitress helped us right away with drinks, and took our orders fairly promptly. I had pretty good company that night so I can't remember how long our wait was for the actual food, but between the appetizer and burgers I don't think it was too bad.  My lunch visit was far worse. The friend I was with didn't quite know what she wanted to order right away, so after his first visit our waiter said he'd be back in a few minutes. I think we waited almost 20 minutes for him to return, and at least another 25 for our food to arrive once ordered. We sat down at 12:30pm in the middle of lunch, it was fairly busy but by the time we ordered the place had mostly cleared out so I didn't see why it would take that long. Her unpreparedness aside, our entire lunch took almost an hour and a half from sitting down to finishing our meal, far too long for folks that typically have an hour lunch break around town. I'm not sure if this is a common occurrence during the day, but considering that two out of three meals I've eaten here were sub-par in the service category, I might be noticing a trend here.  The food itself is fantastic. Since having a Kiki burger on my first visit, I have since tried the Ronin burger and the Kalbi burger. Both burgers came out medium rare just as ordered, had all fresh, amazing toppings, and did not disappoint. The different combinations of kim chee, kalbi sauce, fried egg, and other Asian-inspired toppings are all succulent and the best examples of their flavor. I had the pickles during one meal which consisted of not your typical pickles, but pickled daikon, garlic, cauliflower and a few other items. It was delicious and different. Not too filling, but great flavor and a good prep for things to come. Both times I stuck to the parmesan and black truffle fries per request from my company at the table. The fries have great flavor, but during my most recent visit I had the chance to eat some of the fries with little seasoning on them near the bottom, and they weren't too great on their own. Still, all of the fries I have seen and tried here are loaded with seasoning and great in flavor.  I'm not going to bother giving Bachi a new score, the burgers have been incredibly consistent and fantastic, but the service is just not what it should be from visit to visit. If you're not on a lunch break or in a rush, it is well worth the visit and still in my opinion one of the best burgers you can have in town. If impeccable service is your thing, then you need to loosen up a bit and get in here to see what you're missing out on. And if you are an employee of Bachi, please take note of my service comments. I'm sure you get slammed during lunch time and at dinner, but respect the hour-long lunch break and try to find ways to get your customers in and out of there with some efficiency.
837	1	Drunk food at its best! This little gem is hidden in Cosmo. Came here after a crazy night at Marquee. I was actually surprised the line wasn't longer but there was still a good amount of people. Line moves quick so no worries.   Pizza slices are about $5 but really depends what you get. I tried the White Pizza and the Pepperoni and they were both amazing. My favorite one was the White Pizza. Not sure if I was just drunk and hungry or if the pizza was just THAT good.
838	0	First of all, if you're in a Tix 4 Tonight line wondering whether or not you should buy a discount ticket to the Cravings buffet, I'd advise you to choose another place.  But more about that at the end of my review.  The food itself was nothing to get very excited about.  The high point was the Andouille sausage which had a kick to it and real flavor.  Ironically, the low point was the Cajun chicken, which looked the part but had little flavor and was so dry it was barely edible (and I prefer dry poultry to juicy).  The rest of the food, as many pointed out, was pretty bland, kind of like Golden Corral with less choices.  They do have free alcohol, so if you're more interested in drinking than eating, this may be the place for you.  I don't drink, so this was little consolation for me.  Another Yelper recommended getting a discount coupon.  I had one and came at about 1:00 PM for lunch.  The coupon (from Tix 4 Tonight) listed a lunch price of $11.99.  There were three of us, so I was expecting to pay about $40.  Imagine my shock when the Cashier announced my bill was about $80.  I told her I wanted lunch and she told me they weren't serving lunch "today."  I went ahead and paid and immediately checked their website on my phone only to discover today meant ever.  There is no reference to lunch, only Breakfast, Brunch and Dinner.  Is the Mirage or Tix 4 Tonight to blame for the bait and switch/misrepresentation?  I guess that's a question for the Nevada Attorney General to figure out, I'll update to post any response I get from them.  But given the cashier's slick reply I'm guessing it's the Mirage.
839	0	Ok, here's the scoop. We're Las Vegas locals and try and hit most of the Strip and off Strip restaurants, buffets included. We gave it a whirl for Saturday night dinner buffet.  First stop  ..the centrally located Seafood island. We got a sampling of crab legs, oysters on the half shell, yellowtail sushi etc. The crab was mushy, I also got a few bad oysters (mushy too), the sushi was passable.  Next we hit the rest of the lines offerings.  Skipping most to try a few items I normally like. Tried the obligatory Prime Rib, which was fine, but certainly not as good as a stand alone Prime Rib restaurant. Tandoori chicken was next.  The chicken was ok, but very dry. I then got a few slices of deli salami.  All were overly chewy and had a funny taste. At that point I went on to some melon , all of which were totally unripe and tasted like cardboard.  I finally went to the desert station and got a small sampling of baked goods. They were ok, but I have to say I was disappointed that they had no ice cream to complement the Bananas Foster. In all fairness they told me the machine was broken.  All in all, I would say the meal was mediocre.   The meal was barely passable, however we will not be making a return trip. My wife made the same comments to me. If you want a truly good buffet, try The Bachanal at Caesars Palace. It was NOT worth the price of admission.
840	0	Dear Pink's,    I hate you.  I had one in LA and it was ok but I was hoping for better...I'm not sure why I thought it would be better.  I think it's similar to when you see a McD's ad and you hope your burger looks like the ad but it's the same pile of crap every time.    The chili was bland and the hot dog was not as good as Nathan's hot dogs.    I'm pretty sure the chili dog meal looked the same entering and exiting my body!
841	1	If you feel like leaving the strip and "venture" a little around Las Vegas, definitely check out the Hash House a Go Go. Not a cheap cab ride from the strip, but it's totally worth it. I love this place!  Portions are huge, but you can always take your leftovers, so stop crying about how big they are! They have a DJ so, if you want a quiet breakfast this is not your place, otherwise, you would love it, fun environment. Food is very tasty and fresh.
842	0	Just returned from a Vegas weekend and this restaurant and service was just terrible. The layout of the restaurant should have been better to accommodate size and demands of tourists and visitors instead of only being able to service the basic size of a mom & pop shop. It has a great area for outdoor seating but the shade and covering or cooling was not enough for Nevada 104+ F demands. The host and service was NOT great at all and good luck trying to find a seat and service with a party greater than 3. We were forced to wait an hour and a half in 104 F when we just had to give up because although we confronted the host as to why several parties were being let in (parties of 1 & 2), our party of 5 is just too big for them and it's easier to let people with smaller parties in. So very rude and not worth the wait.  My highest recommendations to you, if you're willing to pay the same amount for Serendipity 3 go inside Caesars with A/C and comfy seating and shade. Find a bakery called Payard's Patisserie and get their drinks and pastries, just the same price (perhaps portions are smaller regarding pastries but they are in French style-size, drinks are huge) and BONUS they give free samples.  Will fly to NYC for the original shop and avoid this mock.
843	1	Ill keep it short and simple!   Food = AMAZING.  -I am not the easiest to please, but paying upwards of $20 a burger is not on my usual budget for dinner. So, for the price, I was very pleased!  Service = GOOD  Could be a little better. Though they were renovating at the time of our visit so I wont ding them  Atmosphere = OK/GOOD  A little bland for the price. But Id rather pay for the food and not the art on the walls!   I will deff recommend this place and keep going back. Great good!!!!
844	0	I expect better from a Hilton. Nothing terrible, but a lot of little irritations. - if you don't want to valet, you are directed to a different entrance so that you get to schlep your luggage a few hundred yards to check-in. That is just tacky. (but it's Vegas baby!) - after we checked in, late, tired, a guy behind the desk caught us and started trying to pressure sell some sort of prepay three nights get a free night deal. Again, tacky (but it's Vegas baby!) - I'm 6'1" tall, the shower head sat at around 5'3". I really hate turning into a pretzel to wash my hair. - First night, we checked into a room, and the A/C was broken. To their credit they quickly moved us to a new room, but there the TV was broken. The property is a bit tired and needs some work. - To their credit, we forgot an item, we called while on the road, they went up to the room, found it, put it in their property room, and we claimed it when we returned. I ding them because I know they can do better. I have had excellent experiences in other Hiltons.
845	1	Hey! watch out now.. cus the southwest is comin' up! Bachi Burger, MMMMM! I would end the review there.. But Bachi deserves more than that. Seriously, forget the burger truck. Bachi can stay right where it is and I'll come to them anytime. I've only been here once. Thanks to Yelp, it has led me here. But with my stomach willing and all... I would come here every day.  I came here with three others being all Bachi virgins. So we ordered a different burger each. That way we can try eachothers. The inside is fairly spacious and simple. I ordered the Bahn-Mi burger. I'm not sure what Bahn-Mi means, but I'd assume it's a vietnamese sandwich except in burger form. I got to try the ox-tail chili fries and the parmesan truffle fries. Both are deservingly tasty, but I love the parmesan truffle more. They had taro boba but no hot taro milk tea =/. What was more important was that the service was quick and friendly.
846	1	Best burger of my LIFE! I came for my birthday and we almost walked away when we saw the line. Turns out it moved fast and I was impressed with their technology. They send you a text when your table is ready so you can walk away and get a drink nearby and relax. After a short wait we were at our table. You could tell they thought about everything. The waitress was very informed about every item on the menu, even when the food was served they make sure to face every plate in the same exact position.   But let me get to the food. Prices extremely reasonable, especially considering this is a gourmet restaurant. All the choices were appetizing, I went with the Euro burger (truffle, goat cheese, arugula) and my boyfriend the boar. We had the truffle fries to share. Everything was as good as it gets. The meat was cooked just enough and juicy. Again I was so impressed at how well thought out everything was.   I cannot wait to return here!
847	1	Love love loved it!!!!  When I found out we were going to Vegas I KNEW this was the first place I'd hit up... Yes we are DDD groupies and we were not deceived!!!!!!!  We arrived around 1pm on a Thursday - there wasn't a wait!!!!!  Our server was so hospitable - he was polite, attentive, and really seemed to enjoy his job... his cheerfulness actually made me a little happier... He gave us recommendations (even though Guy Fieri already showed me (Kalbi) what I was getting, my BF took the server up on his recommendation (Miyagi San) and wasn't disappointed)!  Like the true fat asses we are, we started with the oxtail chili cheese fries with extra chili aioli on the side - SOOOOO GOOD... The runny egg yolk dispersing over the tender meat, jalapeos, and crispy fries... #heaven! Our burgers were cooked perfectly - medium well, as requested! I love all Asian food - Asian anything makes me happpppppy... so my Kalbi marinated burger with kimchi, HIT THE SPOT... I could eat it weekly and not get sick of it!!!  We finished off with the Portuguese donuts - I wasn't impressed... Mainly Bcuz the donuts were raw on the inside... but I was too stuffed to complain.  Overall this was a great experience (sans donuts)...
848	0	During my first visit, I had the laksa and having tasted laksa in Singapore, I thought their serving was pretty good. So I had high hopes when I came back here for their other noodle dishes like wonton noodle soup. Unfortunately, it was mediocre and overpriced. The serving of noodles was not generous and the broth was sub par.   It took more than ten minutes for the order to be taken because the waiter seemed to be lost and not in the restaurant. However, when I asked for the bill, it came in snap.  I won't come back unless I wanted to satisfy a laksa craving.
849	1	Bumping it up to 5 stars after our last dinner.    You GOTTA try some of the dishes they got going on like the sturgeon confit!  Oh my god!  It was as if a salmon mated with a whole block of tofu and voila!  That may sound terrible to some but goddamn!  I've had plenty of sturgeon caviar but never the actual fish.  The fish was truly amazing both for texture and flavor.    Then there's the veal appetizer.  They slow cook the veal, bread it and THEN pan fry it!  What??  I'll have whatever the chef is smoking please.  Juicy, flavorful and crispy with some great cream sauce.  I would've taken this as an entree.    We also got the saffron mussels and pate which were very good but not as good as the top 2.
850	0	Absolutely disgusting. After getting deathly ill about 10 minutes after eating the cold crab legs (yes, shouldn't have risked it at a buffet) I had to go lay down and was sick all night. THEN the next day I went to talk to the manager who was SO rude. He asked why I didn't say something that night.... Ummmm because I was so sick I had to bolt! And I NEVER get sick from food. He informed me all he could do was call hotel security and file a report. Complete BS. Don't go here unless you want to be sick from shitty cruise ship like food and then treated poorly.
851	1	Tuesday morning is a great time to go, there were several open tables when I arrived for breakfast. I've been here on weekends and the place can get packed.  This time I went with one of their hashes. One had jalapenos and I had to go for it. Spice level for me (a Southern Californian used to spicy Mexican and Asian foods) was fine, though it might have been too much for someone with a more sensitive palate. The hash reminded me of homemade hash, not that garbage in a can that some people think is real hash.  Service was prompt and friendly. Other people in the restaurant were ordering some of the more 'twisted farm food' and seemed to love it. Breakfast and coffee came to $18.10 - a reasonable price in my book.
852	0	Our server Norma was very friendly and responsive to our request.    Ordered the huevos rancheros, the presentation was great the food was just ok. My dish tasted like the Mexican pizza from Taco Bell.  For the price I was definitely expecting more flavor.   We asked for hot sauce and were offered Tabasco. Two thumbs down.
853	1	I love this place I don't even know where to start I all ways go in without eating breakfast so I can fill up on the good stuff and omg there is so much to choose from the Thai tea is so good then I get the oxtail fries witch might I say are to die for  I all ways bring my friends in to they get different burgers so we can all share I love the burger buns talk about melt in your mouth And if you have kids mine get the BBQ burger and all ways clean there plate what more could I ask for its  such great food
854	1	At the suggestion of some local friends we went to breakfast at Hash House A Go Go and it was as advertised.  Very large portions of very good food.  The bacon was thick, eggs cooked perfectly to order and my French Toast was to die for.  I highly recommend this place.  The only rub is that it is busy so be prepared to wait.
855	1	I didn't like the location since it was not easy to find.  Regardless, the service is great: felt like that I was being well  taken care or while not so over bearing.   Their attention to details and a hint of unique culinary color in menu items made it a 'fine dining experience' although customers are bit casually dressed.
856	0	I have to agree with all the other bad reviews.   1.)Rooms are super old, but maybe you need to request certain towers. Did check for bed bugs because me and my daughter were itchy. But didn't see any. 2.)They double charged and now is taking me 3 calls to get refund so I think I'll have to dispute with my bank. 3.)Check in needs serious help in what's called customer service :/ they told me to come back to check in when as soon as I left they were checking in other guest. So I stood and watched for 10min and every single person was being checked in so I sent my husband and bingo we were in.  4.) Empty pool was a bit weird to me. Regardless of it being winter you do have resort fees! 5.)all I can say is you get what you pay for. In my case I'm paying double so I end up paying what would of been a decent place.
857	0	Please don't ever come here! If you love your family do not eat at this place. First things first walking in is the horrible smell. It smells like the inside of a nursing home. No lie. Secondly they do not have a person coming around taking your dirty plates, they will sit on your table for a while in the way of your food. Third it's in the ghetto which would be okay if they had good food and customer service which they do not. Inside gives you the feel that a fight can break out and end up on world star and any moment. And last but not least when we were finished eating sitting and talking about how we will never come here again we see one of the workers cleaning the Buffett area and putting all the food that drops around the sides BACK IN WITH THE OTHER FOOD. I am so traumatized
858	0	Please Tell me, you are not ready  to serve a full buffet yet ! Awesome architecture. People expect more than a prime rib and turkey roast.... Please take a walk over to the Wynn, you can use my $34.00 to buy a buffet with several entrees and hundred more combinations.   Desert menu is OK, but it doesn't make up for stale tomatoes in the salads, they had a pickled taste !  Complained to personnel, didn't even care.   If you are not ready, you should have opened in January.
859	1	came here twice on my honeymoon.  such a delicious breakfast.  hard to go wrong here.  especially when you order the lyonnaise potatoes on the side.  the strawberry croissant is so delicious, i am still thinking about it.  luckily you can order it also at the separate bouchon bakery in the venentian.  love the quiche lorriane and the french toast.  it was all divine.
860	1	Super friendly staff, ambiance is warm and hip. Chicken Karage was perfect, ordered marinated spare ribs, pork belly, beef toro and bulgogi. All was amazing!! They play music videos on a big screen on the wall and it's just the right volume and a great choice of music.   Happy hour is 3pm-6pm and 10pm- close. Ordered broccoli, asparagus, and sweet corn. Perfect amount for 4 people.   Would definitely eat here again when we come back to visit from the Bay!!
861	1	FIVE STAR EXPERIENCE extremely attentive and knowlegable wait staff.  we went in the middle of a shift change.  the waitress introduced us to our new waiter...the transition went smoothly.  staff knew their products and were always willing to go the extra mile food was amazing!  we ordered the japaleno poppers, onion rings, and the euro burger...omg!  my husband is the epitomy of a carnivore.  he loves steaks and burgers.  however, whenever he eats a burger he does this super IRRITATING ritual.  he typically takes a bite...puts it down then says "mine are better."  it typically NEVER fails.  i didnt think here would be any different.  today, he looked at the burger picked it up and took a bite...then he did something he NEVER does...he took another bite...then another...and another.  when he was competely finished he stated, "perfection."  the bun was slightly crisp at the edges but warm and soft in the center.  the patty was perfectly seasoned and wonderfully juicy.  it was awesomeness on a plate.   we'll be back!!
862	1	Simply fantastic place to eat. The service was 5 stars and the place was packed. Our server checked on us constantly, when he found out it was our first time he dropped off two free muffins and never stopped making sure we were good with everything.   The Chile relleno omelette was fantastic and it came out hot and delicious. Normally packed restaurants suffer in service but it was quick and ready and service was on point. No wonder 2000+ hits gave it more than 4 stars.   Stop by and you won't regret it.
863	1	Great service, eggceptional food.  I wish we had such a breakfast place in Salt Lake City. Carla too amazing care of us, and our meals were prepared perfectly, even though the portions were too big.     It was my second or possibly third visit here, and it is consistently great.
864	1	First let me say I am very critical of Breakfast spots. The staff here is great they are all in some form of Osh Kosh or Dickeys(one girl in Plus Four's, vest and pig tails). They were all shapes and sizes with ink and piercings. That alone made me happy! The wait was about 20min(If you have a large group be ready to wait a while, or be willing to break up into smaller partys) full bar makes the wait easy. The food is Huge, but tasty as hell. I wished there were more people at my table so there were more things to try. Oh well I'll be going back on a regular basis. I won't even get into the food I would just butcher the menu anyway. These guys have set the bar really high and have no competiton outside the casinos. If you are local try going on weekdays for shorter wait and less crowd. I wish there were more spots like this in Vegas! (!!!Don't be fooled into going to Hash House it is not the one!!!)
865	0	I found out WHERE NOT TO STAY in Vegas.  I expect a mistake or two and don't usually complain about anything minor but the Riviera Hotel seems to be the epitome of incompetence in the service industry.   First off, we booked a Deluxe Room with two double beds, since it was just me and my grown daughter. We had to wait in a long check-in line and the desk clerk told us and wrote down the wrong room number, so our keys didn't work.  The Bellman came up with our luggage and had to call downstairs to find out what was going on. We were supposed to have a room a few doors down. He let us in but we had to go back down 19 floors to the bell desk to get the right keys. I thought to myself, well if this is the worst thing that happens that's not too bad, even though I didn't see why they didn't bring up the keys themselves since they had screwed up.  We came here on a few days where there was record breaking heat for February.  The pool was closed the entire 3 days we were there but still got charged a $17.00 a night "Resort Fee". People were laying out in the sun in bathing suits but no one could go in the pool.  The first 24 hours:  The Deluxe two double bed room would've been fine. It wasn't too spacious, wasn't too small.  But nothing in the room worked.  I couldn't program the safe, it kept giving me an error code. I had to call security up to fix it. I have never had any problems in other hotels I've stayed with safes. Had to wait for security to fix it.  I noticed it was hot in the room and went to turn the a/c on. I saw a wrench icon blinking. The a/c was not working, had to call maintenance and have them fix it.  The TV remote didn't work most of the time, couldn't see if it needed new batteries, it was completely sealed. It would only work if you were standing about a foot away from the TV, so you couldn't even use it from the beds that it was right in front of.  Even in front of the TV the remote wouldn't work sometimes.  The WIFI only had 4 bars and would cut you off or wouldn't connect at all.  The shower drain was clogged. had to call maintenance again to unclog it.  Called the front desk to complain, They said they would upgrade us to a Deluxe One bedroom suite with two beds for free and it would be ready by 1:30 pm.  The Riviera had told me they guarantee all their rooms to be ready by 4 pm, but we spent nearly the whole day until after 4 pm waiting for the room to be "cleaned". We were starving and had to leave to eat once.  2nd & 3rd days:  Suite was nice and spacious. WIFI was non-existent, even though it showed 4 to 5 bars. One bedside lamp didn't work and curtain puller was broken. View was of the side of hotel and Circus Circus.  We had a DO NOT DISTURB sign on our door yet someone still knocked the next morning. TWICE.  We were leaving around 1 or 2 pm for the day and I called and specifically asked for maid service while we were gone.  I called Housekeeping directly, told them we would be gone but would like maid service. They said someone would be right over.  I left a tip in the gratuity envelope for the maid and placed it on the bar.  When we came back later that evening, the room hadn't been touched. Beds unmade, trash not emptied, etc.  I took the gratuity back out of the envelope and left a note that said basically "I called housekeeping and no one ever showed up so no tip for you".   One of the toilets kept running in the suite. I just got up and jiggled the handle, because it was loud. This happened a few times.  The night before we were going to leave, the safe we had been using with no problems for 2 days suddenly decided to throw up an error code with our valuables locked inside.  I had to wait for security to come up and bypass it again.  The valet and the bellmen were all nice. They received tips.  The lady at the fast food Mexican restaurant downstairs looked angry at the world and the food wasn't that great.  Wicked Vicky's was ok but too expensive for what you got.  On the day of checkout, I called the Bell Desk for help with our luggage and the bellman told me there was no one to check us out at the front desk. So I checked out over the TV system, and it said an e-mail would be sent to me. It didn't ask for an e-mail address so I assumed they meant the one they had sent 3 different confirmations to when I made the reservation.  When I returned home there was no e-mail. I called the hotel and they said they sent it to some e-mail that was close to mine but it was not right.  How is it they could send me 3 different e-mails before our arrival, yet screw up our e-mail address upon departure? I am wondering now if my credit card will be charged correctly as the charges are still "pending".  I can live with a few inconveniences, I do all the time.  I was sad to be leaving Vegas but happy to leave the Riviera, which is something I have never felt leaving a hotel (or motel) before.  They need some renovation and new management.  Poor service overall. Unapologetic about it too.
866	1	Best Thai food of your life unassumingly located in an off-Strip sketchy strip mall, with the accolades and photos with celebrities adorning the walls and full tables to prove it.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu; however the pad thai, crispy duck, and braised short rib with panang were standouts.
867	1	Steak is vibrant fine-dining.  If you're looking for a stuffy, hoity-toity dining experience, go somewhere else.  It's a nice meal, so plan 2-3 hours to enjoy it.  if you want to grab a bite, they have a bar area that serves a few of the appetizers, a big version of the american kobe sliders, and fish and chips.  The overwhelming feeling you get from dining there is that there is a team (dare I say army) of staff looking after your dining experience.  Each table gets a waiter, a backup waiter, a sommelier, and a countless number of staff that fill in the gaps (filling water, etc).  Ladies would be escorted to the restroom if anyone saw them stand up and while they were gone, someone (the sommelier a lot of times) would stop to fold up her napkin and chat until she returned (pulling the chair out for her).  Just Bravo to everyone there... I've never felt more cared for in a service establishment.  Oh, and when the food arrives, each diner's plate is served by a single waiter and served in unison (the visual effect is amazing).  Before getting to the food, I have to tip my hat to the kitchen.  For all of the great front-of-house staff, they really went above and beyond.  Having a fascination with scotch eggs at the time, I wanted to try one of the scotch quail eggs that comes on the caesar salad and was willing to pay for the salad just to get the egg.  Nope, compliments of the chef for the entire table.  Every item on that menu was prepared beyond reproach and special requests handled perfectly.  Get a soup, starter, dinner, and dessert (and I'd recommend that order too).  The British ale onion soup is the best if going for meat as your main (just sets everything up nicely), and the asparagus soup is perfect if going for seafood (very seafood-y taste... in a GREAT way).  My favorite appetizer was the foi gras, followed by the pork belly (the pork rinds served as garnish were silly good too).  The american kobe rib cap is the richest cut of steak I've had.  The key thing is that they really don't do anything to the steak... that's left up to you.  I guess the idea is to let the cut speak for itself (which it does) and you can use the peppercorn on the plate to change up the flavor a bit or get a sauce on the side (not a bad idea to have for about half-way through the steak).  Sides... mac & chese, always.  You only need 1 order for 4 people because it's SO RICH!  All others were great, this one just stood out the most.  Dessert, find one you don't like, I dare you.  The chocolate layers is a dark-chocolate dream, the sticky toffee pudding is insane, but I'd go so far as to say that the best dessert on the menu (the one that sticks with me the most) was the peach trio.  It's just a refreshing end to whatever meal your having.  Oh, final note... get still water rather than tap.  Yes, it's silly to pay for water, but the flavors are so strong that tap water tastes REALLY bitter between courses.
868	1	Always a great meal at Hash House. Love everything I have tried on the menu from the salads to the salmon and of course the chicken and waffles. Service is nice and the portions as well as quality justify the price which is about $15-20 per entree. Food comes out quickly and is beautifully presented, a staple every time we come to Vegas!
869	1	I'm disappointed by a lot of breakfast joints, but this one was AMAZING.  If I could I would eat here everyday.    I ordered the Sage Chicken and Waffles, the portion was literally bigger than my head and was the best tasting chicken and waffles I've ever eaten.  Also, the waffles were stuffed with full sized strips of bacon.  Disclaimer : Everything brought to the table was dressed with a sprig of sage, so maybe sage is just their thing, but it's delicious.
870	1	I really enjoyed this place!  The food is setup in good portions and the sides that come with it are both tasty and interesting!  I would definitely skip the strip restaurants and try this place instead. I got the filet with bacon wrapped asparagus a long with tempura veggies!
871	0	I ALMOST gave this place 3 stars, but the wait and service was so bad I can't make myself give anything higher than a 2. The 2 stars is based on the extra delicious frozen hot chocolate (that we had a coupon for, making it free), and the hot dog that ended up tasting pretty good.   Ok, so my husband and I got to Serendipity 3 at a decently off time. Didn't look too busy, so we put our names on the list and took a seat outside. We overheard someone say that if you sit at the bar you'll get served faster and you don't have to put your name on the list, so we tried that....didn't work. There are 4 or so chairs at the bar, so there went that idea. More waiting, waited so long that we had to eat a snack bar I had in my bag....before we ate lunch! I think our wait totaled about an hour for just the 2 of us. We were seated and it took our waiter 10 minutes before he came over to greet us and take our drink orders. Found out a few of the items that were on the menu were not supposed to be on there any longer (one of the items I was going to order, figures), so my husband ordered the grilled cheese with tomato soup and I ordered the mac & cheese. Simple enough. Our free frozen hot chocolate came out in this giant sundae glass,it was amazing! So good! We were expecting a tiny glass since it was free, but this could have fed a family of 4! Our food came out 35 or so minutes later, and my mac & cheese tasted like lighter fluid! It was so gross that even thinking about it right now makes me gag a bit. My husband's grilled cheese was gross too, same lighter fluid taste. Even his soup tasted like lighter fluid! I assumed it was the way they were cooking things so we brought this to the waiter's attention. He took my food back and came back to tell us that the cooks had no idea why it tasted like that and that no one else had complained. He offered to replace my gross food with something else, so I ordered a hot dog. Figured it would be safe since it wasn't covered in whatever gross cheese they were using.   We waited for my hot dog for 30 minutes!  A HOT DOG! I'm kind of hypoglycemic so by this point I was feeling pretty weak. I started spacing out, feeling nauseated, it was all I could to stay calm. My hot dog FINALLY came and I was at that point in my 'episode' where I was super nauseated, so I took a few bites and got a to-go box, which took another 10 minutes. It was just annoying how much time we spent waiting and the food wasn't even good. I ate my hot dog an hour or so later after I was feeling better and it was pretty good. If I ever went there again i'd go straight for that and a frozen hot chocolate, that's it. And i'd get it from the to-go window, not even bother going inside. My husband is curious about this giant donut we saw in the to-go window, so we might check that out next time. Not going out of our way though.
872	0	Wow.  You would think that this place would have a warning sign saying "Everything here is great....except the buffet".  This place was remniscent of an old-folks home in the midwest.  Bland, boring, really not good food.  I felt like I was on an all-you-can-eat crap-fest.  Trying to choose the least bad thing there.  Looking back, I should have asked for my money back.
873	1	Incredible...got the gagnam for two people. This included an insane amount of incredible food. The meats are cut perfectly and in a way that people afraid of grilling wont mess it up. All of the sides are awesome and the bibimbop is great. The value and quality of this plsce are some of the best in Vegas.
874	0	What a huge disappointment. I was really wondering if the comments were true so we took a chance and we lost big time they only had 4 little rows opened with very very small selection of food. The only reason why they even got 2 stars at all was because of the desert selection. On the upside the staff is very friendly the environment is very pleasant and clean I love the pictures on the wall but that's about it.
875	0	Right when I entered the hotel it was EMPTY. I never seen an empty hotel in Vegas before. When I stepped inside the elevator, it smelled like urine mixed with barf combined.... (gross) we requested a non-smoking room, but all the rooms allowed smoking.... so we are pretty much second hand smoking. DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE!
876	1	On a bachelorette party trip to Vegas, I think we ate every meal at Bouchon!  Must haves include:  Sourdough waffles-  Umm, why don't we have these in San Francisco?  I don't even like waffles. The vanilla bean butter made these feel like dessert.  French toast- dessert for breakfast.  Croque Madame- Amazing grilled cheese (it better be at $19). So good it is on the brunch and dinner menu.  Kir Royal- The best adult beverage of your life, blackcurrant champagne fizz  Warning: The coffee may cause you to found a new religion or branch of philosophy.  No matter how hung over, you will not be hanging out by the pool after a cup of this Joe!  For dinner,  Salude de Poulpe- I have a soft (not rubbery) spot for octopus.   Followed by Truite aux Almandes- picture almonds, lots of almonds, over a bed of  green beans and butter.    No dessert this time.    To make the weekend last for the rest of the week, I brought home Macaroons in neon colors.  Each one was  essence of pistachio, coffee, strawberry, lemon, vanilla or chocolate that melts in your mouth.  Perfect with my morning coffee.    Can't wait to go back.
877	0	I made a bad choice coming here for breakfast/brunch.  My husband and I didn't want to drive out and we should have!  I ordered the biscuit with sausage gravy-- eggs where rubbery when they were supposed to be poached! Waffle was bland and the breakfast burrito was okay.  Even my son's kid's meal did not taste good.  We could went to Hash House or somewhere else for almost $90 bucks!!!! Lesson learned
878	1	The Billionaire burger, though pricey, is definitely worth it. The foie gras compliments the burger so well. The flavor of all its components are exceptional. I wanted more! Loved the selection of spiked milkshakes (definitely recommend the tiramasu) and other alcoholic beverages to wash down the beef. We'll be back soon, no doubt.
879	1	The food was great, huge portions.  We couldn't finish our plates.  The presentation was excellent complete with sage and twigs.  The service was great, Robert P. was very helpful with the menu.  Seeing that Man Vs Food and the New York Times liked the Sage Chicken, I had to give it a try, and it didn't dissapoint.  They also have a great wall of fame at the entrance.
880	0	I did love the room. However I'm on a NON Smoking floor but have complained daily due to chain smoking and weed. They will do nothing About it. They said I have to know who it is. Are you kidding me. Come up here and see for yourself! I have a headache from all the smoke!
881	0	Where do I start? We were seated at a table in the center the waiter seemed nice at first. He offered us a great coupon if we ordered a pitcher of sangria or margherita, and said it was a great deal. So we ordered the Margherita. We ordered the all you can eat salad and meat and added the seafood ( overcooked shrimp) and went to get our stuff from the salad bar. That's where it turned bad. The person tending was cleaning the dropped food off and pushing it back into the containers with his rag, seriously disgusting!!! So we skipped eating that. Our sad plates were never taken away, and fresh plates for our meat was never given. We had to use the salad plate, and pushed what little we had on them to the side. If my feet hadn't hurt so bad we would have walked somewhere else, but I needed the break. So we gave the meats a try... the shrimp was bland and chewy. The only 2 meats that came around were extra extra extra well done and disgusting. We were ready to walk out... so upset this was my birthday trip and dinner. He said oh you're done (after he had been lost in a portal somewhere, for quite some time) I replied yes I can't eat this stuff. We expected for a manager to come over... nope, that would be good service. Instead he brought us our bill and showed us what 20 &25% tip would be. Really? A tip for no service, bad food, lack of meat selection and a recycled salad bar? Seriously avoid this place at all costs. I have never done this before but I will be handwriting a letter to the management so they know just how bad this experience was. Overall: service: terrible Food : there aren't words to explain how bad it was both selection and taste Cleanliness :  horrid!  Pushing dropped salad bar items back into the containers on the salad bar. Can you even imagine what goes on behind closed doors?
882	0	A seductive female devil sporting a two piece bikini, thigh high boots and a pitch fork surrounded by flames & palm trees got my attention.  While staying at the Monte Carlo on Las Vegas Blvd we thought we hit the jackpot having a Diablo's Cantina attached to the hotel.      The food was kick-ass, I will give them that.  The guacamole was creamy, packed with just the right amount of heat and was topped with diced tomatoes & a sprinkle of fresh sea salt.  We also ordered the chicken nachos, holy shit they were huge.   They had to have weighed at least 5 pounds.  Fresh crisp tortilla chips layered with melted cheese, shredded chicken and lines of sour cream.  Seated at the tables closest to the side walks enjoying the people watching we were spotted by a couple we knew and they joined us for some drinks.  They asked the server to bring us another round clearly saying that the round was on them.  The server not only charged them, but when we received our bill, we were also charged for the same drinks.  I explained to her that you already charged the couple who left for those drinks, and as good as they were I did not lose track of how many $7.50 margaritas I drank.  She then played dumb and sent over the manager.  The manager showed up running his mouth like he wanted to fight. Already having had several drinks & knowing how little the LVPD tolerates patrons beating up a manager of a bar no matter how rude and obnoxious he was, I simply smiled, stiffed the waitress on the tip & left.  Until the incident with the blatant double charging of the drinks and the unnecessary attitude from the manager I thought the food, drinks & atmosphere were 5 stars!! Just a heads up to Diablo's staff, dumb clueless servers who hustles there customers with her pimp like manager's support gets you very few stars.
883	1	Favorite Korean BBQ spot in Vegas! FYI - it's not AYCE, but it ends up coming out to ~$30/person anyway (unless you have a huge appetite) so comparable in price. Quality of meat, variety of offerings, and service are all better than what you receive at AYCE joints. Also nice, central location away from all other Spring Mtn spots. Highly recommended!
884	1	After my wedding on Saturday, we had an impromptu early dinner/mini-reception on the recommendation of my Dad who came here in the late 70's.   I'm a big fan of classic places that have lots of nostalgia. This one fit the bill perfectly. The wife and I split a couple 64oz Scorpions while I had Munch's Breakfast and she had a BLT.  All 14 people there loved the food and nobody was able to eat their entire plate.   We retired to the Lounge for a Mai Tai or two and had a great time. Best of all, my Dad said it was just how he remembered it from over 30 years ago. I'd return in a heartbeat.
885	1	The Waffles and Sage Fried Chicken.... YUM!   My wife ordered the waffles and Chicken, I had the pancakes. While the pancake (singular) was impressive, there is only so much pancake I can eat in one sitting.   The Waffles and Chicken was very good. The waffles had thick cut bacon cooked into it and literally a mountain of food. The waiter told my wife good luck as he dropped it off and I could only roll my eyes as I knew it was on. Four Waffles and 2 pieces of chicken which next time we are going to split.  This location was absolutely packed with a short waiting list which was worth it. We'll be back!
886	1	Never in my life did I expect to succumb to the chicken and waffles craze. But my friend invited me here for brunch and after reading the reviews I had to consider it.  And then I ordered it. And oh my was it delicious. Moan with happiness every five minutes delicious. I pretty much had a near religious experience with this dish. The roasted chicken + brown Thanksgiving-style gravy paired with the bacon and chive waffle + vanilla bean butter + maple syrup all sounds like an odd couple, but was absolutely and positively magical. The flavors mixed together so amazingly that I was in shock. Every now and then I'd eat only the chicken or waffle, but would quickly return to the well engineered combo. That's right, engineered - it was clear that this dish was well thought out.  Now that I've gushed about the chicken and waffles to the point of boring you, I must also note that the complimentary bread and butter were also divine. And the house coffee is some of the best coffee I've ever had. Truly an amazing experience all around, and one that I will be dreaming of frequently.
887	0	My girlfriend and I recently had an late dinner here and it was terrible. We had to wait in line for 20 minutes with 2 people ahead of us. The service is really slow and the staff was not friendly.  We had the chicken wings and the Greek salad, both were not that good.  We did not even eat a quarter of the food. I expected more from a place inside the Bellagio.
888	0	This one star is for our server she was so nice and took really good care of us.  This place was not worth the money. You can find much more reasonable buffets with better food. Food was cold appeared to have been sitting out for a while because some of it was dried out.  We even asked to speak to the manager to voice out concerns. He was pleasant but absolutely useless. He never checked the food on the buffet and never did anything about our concerns. I had been there a few years ago and it was much better. My advice to anyone reading this is too go someplace else.  Not worth the price at all.  Vegas has too many other options so don't waste you time or money at this place.
889	1	I love it. The charbroiled prawns were amazing, even with mouth on fire from the chilis (we got the spicy ones). Definitely order some of the northern Thai dishes the place is known for.  The only thing we got that was just average was the Drunken Noodles - I've had better elsewhere.  But even they were devoured by the end of the meal.  I will make this a must-eat on Vegas trips!
890	1	My 300th review, and what best celebrates that then with a review for the best darned breakfast/lunch joint in TOWN! I'm from San Francisco, and I wanted to eat somewhere OFF the strip. (I was staying at Vdara). So I yelped Egg and I, and ventured off the strip with my rental car and my husband. My husband of course was a bit hesitant to venture off the strip, but he was SO happy I found Egg and I. (We ate here every morning of our 3 day stay). It was seriously that good.  We ordered- breakfast burrito (ordered with egg whites and light cheese) A+ chicken fried steak: A (better to get sauce on side IMO) chicken omelet (it had a "special" name to it) A+ Denver omelet (ordered with egg whites and light cheese) A+ whole wheat pancakes (HUGE ORDER!) A+ Portions are big, so don't order too much!  Service was great! We had the same server all 3 days. She was surprised to see us back on the 2nd day, but was just laughing when she saw us the 3rd day. A bit funny I know :) She made sure our visit was pleasant, asking if we needing anything. The only thing I needed was help walking out their door, since I ate so much.   I hope Egg and I continues to serve great food. Sadly we don't live in Vegas, so we can only visit when we need to sunbathe and gamble :) So that's twice a year, hopefully more!  Thanks Egg & I, for a 5 STAR experience.
891	1	I ate here on my birthday and then I seriously dreamt about it for days on end so I had to come back within a week.  The Miyagi-san burger is amaaaazeeee and so are the oxtail chili cheese fries & truffle parmesan fries.  Service is great, but they seem really rushed.  I don't mind, because I'd rather spend more time eating my food than talking to the server.
892	1	We came here after a day exploring Red Rock Canyon in a group of 9. Trying to figure out where to eat, someone suggested trying this place after he saw it on DDD. I looked it up and remembered I already had bookmarked it after seeing so many great reviews, we had to go! Upon arriving we did run into a little snag, there seemed to be a bit of a wait and a lot of people in the group were getting grumpy.. We almost left, but my ever hungry friend really wanted to eat here, unusual for a guy who didn't want to wait to meet his idols Penn & Teller! Maybe his foodie senses were tingling. I knew mine were, the burgers coming out to people's tables looked amazing.  We stood around for a while, then we were moved to the back porch so we can sit while we waited. There were quite a few empty tables for a place that had a long wait, I can only assume they only seat people they can feed so people don't get pissed that the food is taking too long to come out. Makes sense I suppose. We finally got seated after waiting almost 45 minutes. From there things improved, food came out relatively quickly. We started with the Ox Tail Chili Fries. Impressively good, it disappeared quickly. When it came time to choose my burger I had a hard time deciding, they all looked so good! It was a tie between The KiKi and Mr Ho. A few others wanted to try Mr. Ho, so I chose the KiKi and a Mr. Ho to split with the group. As we waited we snacked on the Salt & Pepper Garlic fries, which had some fresh ginger thrown in which I wasn't expecting, a nice surprise as I love ginger. Our burgers came out fairly quickly. My KiKi was pretty good, the Shogun my ever hungry friend had was really good, but the Mr. Ho pretty much stole the show with it's combination of beef and Lup Cheong sausage on top not to mention it's purple Taro bun! It's a good example of how you don't need to spend $25 on a burger, at $10 Mr Ho is a bargain.  Certainly one of the highlight meals of my Vegas trip, my only complaint other than the initial wait, would be that we don't have Bachi Burger back home.
893	1	"I'm so glad we did this, baby," are the words my husband said as we were leaving the Paris after celebrating our anniversary here. We did not order appetizers but we enjoyed the variety of breads offered to us. The wine selection is significant and they can make any cocktail you would like. My husband had the Beef Wellington and I had the bone-in rib eye. Both were cooked to perfection. I ordered my steak medium plus. It was very tender and perfectly seasoned. I think it's the best steak I've had!The beef Wellington comes medium rare and can be cut with a butter knife! It definitely exceeded our expectations. The fingerling potatoes were a bit garlicky but the Mac and Cheese was excellent. We ordered coffee with desert and that was an event! The coffee is made with a French press and comes with "ABC" spoons. The spoons are covered in chocolate and each contains a liquor ... Amaretto, Baileys, and a Cordial (raspberry). We had to try the Sticky Toffee Pudding cake and brown butter ice cream after reading the reviews. All I can say is "Wow!!" It was delicious!! This can definitely be shared. Our server was Lomberto and Ryan was helping. They were extremely attentive! Whatever we wanted, Lomberto would make it happen. He really helped to make this a memorable experience.  I highly recommend Gordon Ramsey Steak if you're in Vegas. If you're local ... You gotta give it a try!!
894	1	New York style pizza! This is everything you could want in a pizza - the perfect dough, grease that drips down your arm, and big, foldable slices.   What I loved most was that staple flavors, like pepperoni, cheese or veggie, were just what you'd expect but SO flavorful!   The white pizza was amazing. No sauce - mozzarella dotted with heaps of herbed ricotta, slathered with a buttery garlic sauce.   The sausage with onion and green peppers was perfect too. Spicy, thinly-sliced Italian sausage made for some perfect bites.   Love this place. Highly recommended for any time of the day!
895	0	Great for kids and worth a visit once if only to use the slide. A tourist spot and of course we were tourists. The wait team was great and the food rolled out like a hotel banquet service. The food overall was just ok but we went to give kids a unique experience. Mission accomplished.
896	0	This place sucks!  Ordered some beers at the bar waiting on a table to open outside, bartender was rude.  Get outside, waiter ok, but guy who brought our food was rude when he threw it on the table.  Waiter never came back to check on us after the food was ordered!  Love this place in the Bahamas but not in Las Vegas... No fun here! Stick to Senor Frogs in the Caribbean ...
897	0	No.  Obviously you don't have very high expectations when going to a place like this.. it's basically a glorified bar.. and this location is on the Las Vegas Strip...and to basically mimic what another reviewer said: the service was sloooow - and the food was GROSS.   I ordered a 'chicken fajita burrito'.. which came to he table as a 'BEEF fajita burrito'.. about 35 minutes after it was ordered..AND it had CHILI all over it... like beef chili.. slopped over the top.. along with fake canned cheese.. which I guess would be fine, if that is what I had ordered.. and i was extremely drunk.  It was incorrect.. it looked unappealing.. but hey, I gave it a chance. Sufficed to say, I won't be going back for that particular menu item. (I did mention to the server that it was incorrect... he claimed they sent the wrong one, and I said I would deal with it.. but on the bill, it was listed as BEEF Fajita Burrito..as in.. he ordered the wrong item and lied to me about it.) Mistakes happen.. I get it... I'm just sayin.  The 2 friends I was with, both decided it was pretty bad service as there were missing utensils, drinks for the 3 of us were coming one at a time.. and there really seemed to be no excuse for the lack in service, because they were not at all busy.   We all agreed that the drinks weren't bad.. and the outdoor patio is a nice attraction to ''people watch' from .. but other than that.. I will not be eating any of their "signature" dishes again...ever. They had chicken tenders with fries on the menu, and if I ever visit this spot again to have drinks.. and decide that I am hungry (and very lazy, because there are 10 better choices less than 50 feet away, ) I will be having those.   I don't recommend the food at all. The drinks were good and the Jeremiah Sweet Tea Vodka(?) Drink.. was tasty albeit very  sweet... but I did have 2! Anyway.. that's that.. good luck in your dining adventures!
898	0	If you are a tourist this is probably one of the best options on the stip to go and dance latin music. However, if you are a local I would not recommended.  This restaurant/bar has two floors: the first floor has the restaurant area where you can eat next to the dance floor. They play R&B, rap and a little bit of everything. The problem is that is next to the patio so I don't think they have AC, or if they do is extremely hot!! ( I promise you I'm not on my menopause yet and I was sweaty). on the second floor, they play Latin music, the dance floor  has a decent size, but I went on a Saturday night and there was hardly anyone there.. So if you have better option, I would totally go somewhere else.
899	1	Amazing. Food-gasm. Thomas effing Keller to the rescue. Words cannot describe my experience at Bouchon. I had the chicken, for god's sakes, and it was INCREDIBLE. The baguette? Like I had in Paris (yep, threw in the pretentious Paris card). Even the butter was amazing. Ended the meal with the lemon tart and could have died I was so happy. Do yourself a favor--go to Bouchon. Just go.
900	1	Damn good burgers. I had the truffle burger and it was top notch -- cooked perfectly, well- seasoned, and juicy. Expect to wait in line. Also, I highly recommend sharing the fries as you're paying 8-12 for them but they're large enough to share between 3 people.
901	0	After a very long flight it was suggested we check out Citizens for a late dinner. We asked to be seated inside because the band playing in the bar outside was SO loud. It didn't make a difference. Our server greeted  us quickly and was very enthusiastic. We ordered the fish & chips and the tuna melt plus waters. Food presentation was beautiful.  unfortunately the fish was over cooked and the potato salad, al though made in house, lacked flavor. In the end our bill was $50 for a mediocre meal. The fish and chips was definitely over priced, $26!
902	0	Background: As an avid leisure traveler and a seasoned business traveler, I spend about 100 nights a year in hotels all across the country. (75 % of those nights are booked on hotels.com)  I'm not tough to please when it comes to accommodations as I frequently stay in a wide range of hotel types, everything from Days Inn to Ritz Carlton, so this review inst bias in anyway.    Typically when I come to Vegas, which is at least once or twice a month, I stay at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino. I've recently decided to expand my horizons and begin trying out different hotels each time I visit. So I started with the MGM Grand.   Hotel: MGM Grand Hotel & Casino Location: Las Vegas, Nevada Dates: 3/25/15 - 3/27/2015 Room Type: Executive King Suite Room #: 20206 Room Rates: Night 1- $202.27       Night 2- $148.33 Hotel Fees: $64.96 Room Service/ Dining:$389 Gambling: $1100   This particular trip happened to be a 2 year anniversary getaway for my girlfriend and I. After the short but always dreaded drive from Southern California, we arrived at the MGM. We opted to self park in the garage where finding a parking space was a breeze (to be expected mid-week). We made our way from the garage to the Lobby. After a short 5 minute wait in line, we were beckoned to the Check-In desk. As I handed over my credit card and I.D. I inquired about paying for a room upgrade. The lady at the desk said they were sold out and no upgrades were available.. No big deal.  She then proceeded to make a call to check to see if our room was cleaned and ready. After a 20 minute long wait (not exaggerated) she was finally able to confirm our room was ready and checked us in. We made our way to the West Grand Tower and proceeded to the 20th floor where our room was located. As we approached our room, the door was ajar and housekeeping was STILL cleaning our room, even though the front desk confirmed that our room was ready.. We sat in the hallway and waited for another 20 min (still not exaggerated) while they cleaned our room. After 40 minutes, we were FINALLY able to get into our room. (Longest check-In process I've ever experienced).   The room was very well cleaned and in fairly good shape, This specific room appears to be renovated within the past 5 years.  Pros: Clean and Well Kept Large Windows/ Good Lighting Large Spacious Floor plan Automated Curtains/ Blackout Drapes Comfy Sectional Couch w/ Chaise Lounge Large Work Desk 360 degree rotating LCD TV for optimal viewing from entire room Refrigerator/ Mini Bar Dual Lighted Vanity Mirrors in Bathroom Large Dual Sinks in Bathroom Shower w/ Separate Tub Marble Tile Throughout Bathroom Full Length Mirror in Hallway  Recently Renovated  Cons: No Bathroom Ventilation/Fans No Deadbolt on door   As I'm writing this review I'm finding it hard to write a list of negatives about this hotel. If you are looking for a large no frills room/hotel for your Vegas getaway and base your experience on only the accommodations then this is the place for you.   Coming from a marketing background, I've always been a firm believer that customer service is they key to building customer/client loyalty. If people aren't satisfied with their service, they will go elsewhere.  With that being said, I cant say that I will return to the MGM in the future except to gamble or hit up Hakkasan but I would not recommend this hotel to my friends, family or colleagues simply due to the fact of the poor customer service that I experience during my stay.
903	0	If i can give them negative stars i would i booked a room with my gf the room was whatever until we noticed a broken window with lipstick on it we werent gonna be in the hotel room se we left we didnt want to complain so we checked out the next morning and i see my bank statement chared extra from the hotel i call and they said they were charging us for damages "manager" lilly is very disrespectful i get mad immediately because how did they not notice this on the last persons visit shes saying do you want my help?I reapond yeah you need to help me this is not right and she goes no i dont have to help you you want my help and transfers me to security im transfered to a guy who puts me on hold without saying anything and tries to give me another guys number to call monday i say thats unacceptable and he hangs up on me i call back to talk to lily and she transfers me without responding this is the WORST VISIT EVER,dont come here i will repost this review every other day until my money is refunded and im issues an apology stear clear of this hotel not worth it.
904	1	We Americans are a funny group...don't mess with our country or our burgers! East Coast VS West Coast, gosh how did it come to this? The burger bar is set so high nowadays with each new burger joint trying to out do the other. Enjoying a burger is so subjective, it really is all about what you personally like. Its sort of similar to whether you like your margarita with or without salt, there is no right or wrong answer here people!    I personally am a burger purist and I don't like anything other than the old fashioned Cheeseburger with LTO. Well Shake Shack has officially turned me around. A burger thats topped with a Cheese Stuffed Portobello Mushroom?! WTH?! Just the sound of that makes me cringe but I knew this place came with high accolades so I took a chance and since that fateful day I have never ordered anything but the Shack Stack here. Its juicy, flavorful and it oozes...CHEESE! How fun is oozing cheese you ask? FREAKING FUN! Every bite I was amazed at how enjoyable this burger was and I honestly haven't been this excited for a burger in a long, long time. The saying.. "Party In My Mouth" is fitting here. TRY THIS BURGER!  When I first saw the fries I admit I started getting anxious and questioned this decision to walk through NY NY Casino for a burger with Sysco fries. Upon first glance I saw they are the type of fries I was served in school, you know those crinkled and soggy cardboard things the National School Lunch Program passed off as food? Well thankfully they were nothing like the sad sack of fries I was served in high school. These were perfectly and evenly crisped on all sides of the fry. I started chomping away in amazement on how they were able to achieve such an even crisp on all sides of a crinkle cut fry. How did they do it? nom nom...Why has it not been done before? nom nom nom.. This is amazing! I can't believe I'm going to say this... but I like crinkle cut fries now.  We also have enjoyed some of their shakes but my favorite will always be the black and white shake. I think thats where the east coast thing comes in.. I have never had a decent one here in town. Not sure why.. I usually get a puzzled stare when I have ordered one in the past but at Shake Shack I don't have to feel like an weirdo, I fit right in.   Shake Shack is by far the most talked about burger as of late in a city full of burger joints.  And Shake Shack is definitely a place that will stick around. I recommend going there.. Its that good!
905	1	Be prepared to wait, or make a reservation! We had a great experience. We did not make a reservation, so had a drink at the bar while we waited.   Atmosphere was typical of an old school Asian restaurant. There seemed to be no dresscode, as people were both very casual and somewhat formal.   Food was amazing - fresh and flavourful. Service was friendly and relatively quick. Would definitely recommend.
906	1	Lotus of Siam definitely lives up to it's reputation. I love Thai food and I've been to several Thai restaurants around the country and this is easily the best Thai food I've ever had. Not only is the food here amazing but the prices are very reasonable.   My dad and I both had an amazing meal here. We ordered the Nam Ko Tod to start and it was a great start to the meal. It was a great play on sour, salty, spicy, and crunchy texture. Next I ordered the Khao Soi and my dad ordered the Soft Shell Crab Drunken Noodles. Both were phenomenal dishes. We also shared a side of the spicy pork fried rice, which couldn't have been any better. And last but not least we shared the sticky rice with mango and coconut ice cream. This is a must have and was one of the best deserts I've had in a while. It was the perfect way to end the meal, it's very refreshing and not too heavy and not too sweet, a great way to cool down your mouth after a spicy meal.
907	1	We ALWAYS take our visiting friends here, without fail. Asian fusion burgers never tasted better. I love their taro bun burger as well as the banh mi burger. My husband's go-to order is kiki's burger. Since we've started going there about a year ago, they've added a multitude of appetizers and desserts, probably due to the hours extension and additional bar. For the exotic beers they offer, I can see the draw in that. My family and I, however, have only eaten their for lunch or dinner.   We've never had bad service. Beware of wait times, though!
908	1	Being that I stay at the Cosmo now (yes they won me over from Palazzo/Harrah's) I always make it a point to stop at this spot. Lunch or Dinner I think it beats all the high end restaraunts in the Cosmo...especially for the price. The Tapas joint has salty foods, the sushi joint is just ok, Comme Ca - I have yet to try. The cafe on the ground floor is good if you can beat the line.  Now DO NOT go here after the clubbing hours. Its madness, the pies get picked up almost immediately and it takes forever to get a couple slices because people just want something in there tummies to take the buzz off or kill the hangover that is going to come the next night.   GIven its next to Marquee - all the clubbers will hit this spot immediately after partying.  I have met the chef here, and he was real friendly as is most of the staff (Unless its post clubbing time - which is crunchtime for them)! I recommend the white cheese pizza and a simple Pepperoni. But if its late - good luck whatever comes out of the oven first is what you are going to get - but alas - the pies here are all good. I have tried 5 or 6 flavors and none have dissapointed me.   Here's a secret - if you are staying at the Cosmo you can order a whole Pizza and they will deliver it to your room. It takes about 45-1 hour but it beats waiting in line with the rest of the drunkies!
909	0	I generally don't like making reviews so soon after going some place; I prefer to stew around, ask others in the party what they thought, and try to make a well rounded review ... you know, be all pretentious about it.  But, after having dinner here last night and having an extra hour or so while the rest of the family goes off to gamble, I had to vent my disgust with the Grand Buffet here at the MGM Grand.  First off, dinner on a weeknight costs upwards of $39.99 a person, which makes the buffet here one of the pricier ones on the strip.  For comparison, the Wynn and Cosmopolitan charge a buck less on weeknights ($38.99), the Bellagio charges $36.99, and, just to throw it in there, one of my preferred Vegas buffets at the Rio is a scant $32.99 per adult.  So, the MGM charges more than the newer and swankier places in Vegas.  And what do you get for that extra cost?  The short answer is nothing to make it worth it.  When I come to buffets, I don't expect anything more than a lot of average fare.  Typically, you can hope to find most things be not too disgusting, with one or two items that jump above the line, and an equal number than dive well below it.  Here, everything feels dried out from too much time under the heat lamps, meats are under seasoned or overcooked, breads are stale or oddly chewy, and then a couple of high points.  Starting with the carving station, the steaks are flavorless, with no char from the grill, no salty melt to the beef, and most everything we had filled with gristle.  The ribs were overcooked, the fatty trim burned to dry coarseness that was akin to bad chicharrones.   The Prime Rib was overcooked, no pink, close to over seasoned (why couldn't they sprinkle some of that on everything else?), and sharing those ribbons of gristle that ruined the steaks before them.  And, finally, those kielbasas ... well, they were just bad.  The Mexican / Latin station had a bad rendition of Carnitas, which were overly laden with unnecessary vegetables instead of flavoring them with just whatever acid they broke down the protein with and the simmer from cooking it down in its own salty fat.  And the pizza ... my toddler son who normally loves such things, wouldn't even touch it.  On the average end of the scale, the Brussel Sprouts were alright, a bit tough as they didn't seem to be steamed to soften up before roasting, but were also coated in the strong, acrid taste of fennel.    The sushi station was on point for a typical buffet, though not for a $40 a plate one.  They had Octopus Nigiri, an atypical selection, and had a good chew to it along with a fair flavor that didn't have an overly fishy taste.  Salmon rolls had jalapeo slivers with nice heat.  But, on the flip side, no California Rolls or any normal sushi fare you would expect to enjoy.  Macaroni Cheese was fair, tasting fresher than out of the box, and good enough for parents to bite and enjoy while kids feasted on it.  And over at the Asian station, the Egg Rolls were average, if not common / everyday.  Pot stickers are poorly made, none of them cooked down long enough for the skins to become gummy and firm like they should have been, but they still were pretty good, even if they readily fell apart.  And Fried Rice is almost always good.  On the high end, the Shrimp Diablo was fantastic, a good cut to the shellfish, perfectly cooked, and served in a wine sauce with fair heat that was really outstanding.  And the Pear and Gorgonzola Ravioli were a nice blend of sweet and salty, well cooked, and sauced in, what I remember being, a butter cream that made it my favorite dish of the night.  Oh, and their dessert is pretty standard, not quite worth the price tag, but still a good representation of what you should see at a higher end Vegas buffet on the strip.  Plus, they have Ghirardelli sauces!  So, in the end, more disappointments than readily edible food.  Nothing was horrendous, but none of it truly stood out in amazement that came anywhere near warranting the $40 price tag.  I think the greatest mark against this place is all of the poor Yelp reviews that have been tagged by MGM management with their thanks and promise of review ... yet, none of these slights seemed to have been improved in any way whatsoever!  Anyway, if you dropped the cost down to $25 on a weeknight, it might be a solid three stars.  As of right now, it's a very weak two stars in my eyes.
910	0	Expensive and not very good! We were on the brink between brunch and dinner. Food was cold and had kind of gone dead. Seasonings were out of control. I got sick post and probably ate about 4$ worth of the 60$ we paid. They EMT's were carrying a guy out on a stretcher as we arrived! Should have smelled what the Rock was cooking right then! Oh well, Panda Express would have been a better choice!
911	1	I come here every time I visit Vegas.  The food here is incredible. Every time we spend a while here, enjoying a number of courses.    For brunch I had the Chicken & Waffles.  Every part of this is delicious in it's own right, and then also amazing combined.    For dinner I had a series of appetizers and the Gigot d'Agneau (Lamb).  I can't remember this one so well, but I recall that I was very pleased.
912	1	Wonderful selection and choice on their menu - I get so excited when I look at a menu and can't choose! The burgers were out of this world - "The Big Fat Greek" lamb burger was my choice with sweet potato fries and onion rings on the side. I was in the company of "my burger Posse" so we shared - YUM!! From Korean burgers to tandoori - WOW.
913	1	Seriously the best burgers I have ever eaten. My friends and I go to Vegas several times a year and we always go to Bachi Burger several times each trip. You have to try the Kalbi burger and the truffle fries. The sodas are great too. Don't hesitate to try something new because EVERYTHING is so good there.
914	0	holy moly. the worst buffet ever. it was like a bad hometown buffet. my husband had two small plates and decided he didnt want to put his taste buds through any more misery and just start pounding away at their complimentary  beer. everything was cold and extremely salty. i had a bite of the prime rib and i felt like i just put a cube of salt in my mouth -_- at one point they even ran out of clean plates! this buffet cost more than the wicked spoon (which i love) for two ppl we payed about 65$ this buffet was worth 15.99 per person. will never return
915	1	We had a great time celebrating my sister's 40th birthday at Gordon Ramsay Steak.  The wait staff are very professional, attentive and knowledgable. The menu of drinks was impressive, too.  Food was fabulous and  was beautifully presented.  It is a little expensive, but very worth it for special events.
916	0	Came with my family i paid for four an my cousin paid for four an they refused to sit us together they said it was against company policy with so many empty tables unless we paid 18% gratuity for serving water an soda.  Food wasn't fantastic spit 3 things out crab legs were dry so was the brisket, and ham. How can you mess up butter
917	1	[edit-- after subsequent trips back to this place and realizing that the cravings for bachi burger are never ending, I have bumped the rating from a 4 up to a 5. This place is one of a kind.]  This is not your typical burger. If you are craving a cut and dry, lettuce, tomatoes and pickles on a salted angus patty with a slice of American cheese, go elsewhere. If you are a little more open minded and crave the satisfying structure of a burger with a new and unique spin, come on down to Bachi burger.  The wait wasn't too long for the two of us. My girlfriend ordered the Kiki burger and I the Kalbi burger. We shared some parmesean truffle fries which were ultra tasty and came with a sun dried tomato aioli sauce that was perhaps one of the finest sauces I have ever tasted. They were cut thin like average fries but far from average in taste and quality. The burgers themselves arrived 15-20 minutes after ordering and were cooked medium rare as requested. The kiki burger featured sweet caramelized onions and three different kinds of asian mushrooms. My Kalbi burger came with a sweet korean bbq marinade, green onions and enough kimchi to give it a noticeable kick. It was blissful. The meat was juicy and plentiful, the marinade was not excessive or overpowering (although it did drip all over my hands and face) and the balance of the sweet with the spicy kimchi simply turned out to be a winning combination. I'm a man with a respectable appetite and upon finishing the burger and fries was thoroughly stuffed. I had the green tea to drink on the side.  We didn't try deserts or appetizers but we'll definitely be making a trip back here to see what other goodies this place has to offer. The bottom line is that Bachi burger offers a unique, Asian spin on the classic American burger with delicious results. The staff is friendly and the prices are reasonable for a burger that is anything but fast food in quality. Burger fans and foodies alike-- you simply have to try it.

Upon arrival the parking situation was extremely confusing "self-parking" where you pay and "valet" where you pay. I called the front desk and the guest service coordinator let me know that guests of the hotel now have to pay to park EACH DAY. She claimed that this is a 4 month old policy so it was not stated when I booked the hotel. This is outrageous to me especially since I paid $400 a night for the room. You should be able to get it validated if you eat at their hotel restaurant, but the front desk assured me there was no way to get it validated. We checked-in relatively quickly but was never told when check out would be or not given any details about the Wet Republic pool party. When we arrived in our room, we noticed that it was much smaller than the pictures made it seem and we were suppose to have TWO beds, but were given just one. I called guest service once again and was told they only had ONE suite with two beds and it was booked... there was nothing they could do for me. I had to call several times again to retrieve information about check-out and Wet Republic. The guest service customer service is either A+ or horrible - no in between. For the amount of money you spend here, its NOT worth it. I have stayed at the Pink Flamingo for much less and had MUCH better customer service. I will not be spending money here again for future bachelorette parties.
919	1	As I drunkly stumbled upon this place, there was no doubt that my nose had led me to this delicious pizza heaven. JK. But yes I was drunk, but a friend took us here. How could I call Vegas my backyard, if I barely just tried Secret Pizza!!  From what I remembered, the line was quite long, wrapped around the corner, but it was good for me to sober up. The interior decoration was fun, a couple machines for people to kill time with while inhaling that greasy yet mouth watering smell of fresh pizza. As I walked closer to order, my eyes widened and spotted the server tossed a freshly made Mushroom pizza in the bottom pizza drawer, I yelled (I think I yelled), I want that! Oh yes, it was filled with lots of fresh mushrooms and great crust. Wish I had ordered more, but man, it was pricy, but you do get what you paid for.   I am coming back again, hopefully more sober so I can actually take a decent picture and enjoy the pizza.
920	0	Nothing Serendipitous about this place. It was overpriced and the hostess had about as much charm as my sweaty feet from walking in Vegas in 100 degree weather. A bad attitude too. I should've saw the red flag but we needed to evade the "Hot Babes Direct to You" swaggers for a while.  We just had desserts (which were pretty standard) so I can't comment on the food but I won't be back to find out. Our waitress was nice but overall this place had a really crappy vibe. Thanks but no thanks.
921	1	I finally made it back to Bouchon and this time for brunch. It was the best breakfast I had on this trip...er, although I as subject to convention food breakfast, so relatively speaking it honestly doesn't take much to be a best breakfast.  That's not to say the food was bad. No, it was very very good.  Our waiter, whose name I do not recall sadly, led us through some recommendations that we were very happy with.  * Sweetbreads to start. Mmm, glands. It was on the specials chalkboard. * Pan roasted trout, piled with vegetables. With clear eyes on the fish head. Fresh! * Chicken and waffles. Yummy. Is it really French? Do I care?  And lots of coffee.   Definitely the priciest of breakfasts, and worth it.  We admired the selection of absinthe at the bar, and also the good beers on tap.   I couldn't really feel any "food magic" in the space. It felt like the typical good food decadence I feel in the strip area of Vegas.  But if I can walk into a restaurant, see the food I'm eating, and dine without hearing the endless bings and bonks of casino machines, I'm pretty happy. Service and food can't be faulted for anything, for my experience. But I was bummed that the people at two small tables nearby me seemed unhappy. One duo effectively dined alone, as their food arrived 15 minutes apart and there was never a time they had food together on the table. Another, um, gererously portioned couple seemed unhappy with the size of their meals.  Since casinos are probably not very far away from handing out collectible feed sacks to strap to our faces in the buffets, I leave it to the latter couple to sort out what best meets their dining expectations.  For the former, the management came and resolved the issue as best they could and I admire the duo for leaving the waiter a very generous tip, as the timing of the food preparation was not his fault.  I've done a dinner here, as well as a brunch. It was very good, but I probably don't need to return for a meal. Bouchon has kind of blown its wad and I don't get the impression that an encore is necessary. Maybe for some absinthe, or a pastry from the bakery.
922	1	I absolutely LOVE this place! I wish i made billions of dollars when I went to Vegas so I could pig out here all day everyday!  First off the service is wonderful! Everyone was so friendly and all smiles! They are also very helpful in explaining the menu and pointing out favorites.   Bread: so delicious! If only I had 10 stomachs, I would have kept asking for more! It was soft and warm and there was a whole bunch of different ones. And that butter!! It was so creamy, I almost wanted to put the whole butter one only one slice of bread, but I had to share :p  Kurobuta Pork Belly: delicious!  The meat was very juicy. The cheesy grits was awesome and it went really well together.  Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras: it was my first time trying foie gras and I fell in love(Please don't send me hate mail animal lovers, i really didn't mean for it to be this way). The herbed goat cheese pop overs weren't for me, but if you like goat cheese you would love this.   Mac and cheese: very creamy. I usually don't like blue cheese in anything, but it was really good. Couldn't eat too much of it because it was filling.  Demi bone marrow: please order with your steak you wouldn't regret!  American eye wrapped with Mangalista pork: most juiciest and greatest piece of steak I have ever had. I also had a piece of seared foie gras to go with it! The foie and the steak goes so well together. When I eat the foie with the steak, it was like eating a piece of butter with steak and you know butter is life! Haha I feel like all the other steaks I've ever had in my life was a joke!   Overall, this place had made me one snobby steak eater. Steak back at home just ain't the same.
923	1	The wait wasn't too bad, and the burger and sweet potato fries made it worth it. The fries were probably the best I've ever had. Period. Dusted in a vanilla powdered sugar they were amazing. They also served a dipping sauce that had a kick to it. The burger was exceptional. I want to say I had the Farm Burger. I'd definitely go back. :)
924	0	Would classify as hangover food and nothing special. Expensive and not delicious. Located in the opening of a big, smoky casino. Nice stop on the strip if you want to waste money on not so delicious food and just looking to eat anything. The sliders are so tiny and nothing was that great in taste about them. Can't understand why people would select this place for a meal. Would never choose to eat here again, which is why I'm choosing to rate the place with 1 star.
925	1	Amazing burgers!!!  Honestly, the BEST burger I've ever had.  A true chef's creative touch makes these burgess extra special. The Fun-Ghi was the best!!  My husband had the Salmon burger and the sashimi on top of the grilled filet of salmon was the special touch making it fabulous. Kids ate every last bite on their plate as well... CA turkey burger and kids sliders. Will be back if we end up in Vegas next year!
926	1	Came here to eat some Korean food and I was just blown away by how good it was. We ordered many different types of meat and all of them were very tender and good. This place uses real good quality meat.   Another awesome thing about this place is the service. The staff here are A+++++ when it comes to service. Jin was awesome in giving us the best service possible.   I am definitely coming here everytime i come to vegas.
927	1	Eating here for the first time today and I love it! I go to school at UNLV and I never knew this spot was so convenient, I'll definitely be visiting more often. We ordered the Gangnam meal today and the food was brought out very quickly and the workers are very attentive and clear about their variety of food items.
928	0	went on a sunday night with a 50.00 groupon.unlike other places that look at you like you have not showered for a while they where fine with it.asked them if i needed a reservation and they said no so went and did sunday shopping in the miracle mile shops and played the machines for about an hour.rolled back up and was greeted and seated right away. asked and got the table i wanted right near the bar so i could watch a little football.server greeted me in a timely manner.didnt need him to explain the menu as i had been to churascarrias before.went to the salad bar and got some cheese and cheeses bread.the bananas and mashed potatoes where on the salad bar,which i had never seen done before as the back waiter brings them out to you at the other brazilian steakhouses,but seeing as how he didnt have a back waiter i suppose that would say it all.so to the food. i tried everything that they offerred twice,first go around i thought my taste buds were deceiving me as i could not taste any flavor.nope ,i was right,everything was completely tasteless, whereas as tex. de brazil, yolies seemed overly seasoned[although that seemed to be remedied on my last visit] teir rodizio seemed to not be sasoned at all.i you already have a groupon you might as well go as you can do a little shopping and gamblingwhile you are there,but there are better tasting rodizios, that have more buzz about them around town.i gave this only two stars because of the food and ambience,i would give the service 4 stars.
929	0	I've been to other Brazilian places: Texas de Brazil, Fogo de Chao, Via Brazil. All on several occasions. This place is not comparable with the quality of food, dining experience or service.... But it does cost just as much.   The salad bar wasn't up to par because the selection isn't as wide as Texas de Brazil or Fogo de Chao. The cheeses weren't as good, nor the cold meats.   The meats brought around weren't cooked well. The selection of meats was mostly cheap pork or chicken, and I found them fatty. The sirloin, when it finally came, was tough.  Don't pay extra for the seafood. It's basically a plate of crab cakes and tilapia (decent enough) with some unshelled shrimp. Really? Unshelled shrimp?  If you're local just stay off the strip and go to one of the other places. If you're a tourist, it's worth the trip to towne square for Texas de Brazil.
930	1	My boyfriend loves Gordon Ramsay, so it was a must that we try his restaurants when we visited. The burgers are quite pricey here, but definitely worth it. We came here twice during our stay in Vegas and both times, the service & food was amazing!  On both occasions, we had a 15 - 20 minute wait. Others may have to wait longer, but it is worth it.  We ordered the Farm Burger & Hell's Kitchen Burger along with a few sides. The meat melts in your mouth. I would suggest ordering med-rare with a side of jalapeno poppers & truffle fries. They are to die for!  You will not be disappointed. If I am ever in Vegas again, this will definitely be a stop I will have to make.
931	0	I got the all you can eat option 2. The only things I liked here were the cheesy bread rolls, Caesar salad and the sirloin. Both fish were dry along with the shrimp which was a huge part of the meal. This place is just blah. I have never been to a Brazilian restaurant that left me desiring more food.
932	1	This place is awesome!!   Location: Ghetto ass shopping center that if you go at night, looks pretty docile and empty everywhere else in that area.  Food: I had the Nam Kao Tod appetizer which was great. Good amount of food for an appetizer dish and it tasted amazing. I would order this again. For the entree I had this Pad See Ew noodle dish over grilled duck. Since I was with a bachelor party, I got to sample many noodle dishes with mine probably being the most popular. If you love duck & you love Pad See Ew, this is a MUST try! There are other duck dishes w noodles, but the Pad See Ew option was my favorite.   Service: We had a group of 12 or so and it worked out great. Service was fantastic and tended to us well. Everything came out in a timely manner too. I'd def recommend doing reservations here because it's that serious. If not, you'll be waiting a long time to eat.  Overall: One of the best Thai places I've eaten at. Def would go back to try what I haven't yet, and to get another noodle dish. Prices are fair and the menu is HUGE! That was the only tough part for me since I'm so indecisive. However, being in a large group and sharing everything, it made it easier that night. Cab here from the strip isn't that pricey at all!
933	1	Divine. This place is pure delicious breakfast magic. I came here upon the suggestions of fellow yelpers for breakfast and had one of the best meals in my life.  I had a banana nut muffin and the the egg crepe (the one with bacon and guacamole). Everything was spot on. The muffin was moist and flavorful. The crepe was a party of flavor, and the good salsa on the side was a surprising accompaniment for a breakfast place  Though the real star was the people. Service was what sort of thing you would watch in an instructional video. Everyone was nice. Waitresses chatted with customers kids, and you know you're home when you hear, "How are you doing sweetie". This place could easily turn into a must every time I get to Vegas.
934	1	Hidden in a dark hallway in the Cosmopolitan is a hidden jewel, Secret Pizza.  I was staying in the hotel and heard about it through a client.  I never would have found the place otherwise because it's not advertised in the hotel. Despite the lack of advertising the place was packed (a good sign). I'm a New Yorker and a bona fide pizza snob, so to say this place did not disappoint is a big deal.  Fresh, good and inexpensive which is saying a lot in notoriously overpriced Vegas.  Would definitely go back.
935	0	Being a west coaster all my life I was of course excited to try the infamous White Castle.  Boy was I disappointed, probably the worst fast food I've ever had. The sliders were disgusting and the chicken rings we are par with the frozen dinosaur chicken nuggets my nephew eats.
936	0	I'm such an idiot. I didn't check Yelp before I went in. I'm Yelp elite for chrissakes - I check Yelp for everything.  If you're reading this, congratulations. You're making good use of this invaluable public resource. Now you can avoid my experience of spending like $150 on a dinner that was the equivalent of a Howard Johnson's.  How can anyone make pizza taste bad? And how can even the soft serve ice cream suck - how is that even possible??? Apparently, it is. Take my word for it.
937	1	The saddest awesomeness thing happened here .... I came to vegas alone and I told the cashier named Jarde that my bday was comming up in a couple of minutes she was super nice I kid you not she went to the back and gave me a free Ice cream ... Dude this is amazing costumer service! Give this chick a medal or something   Thank you!
938	0	Absolutely worst buffet I've been to. Also extremely overpriced at about $40 per person. I was issued a  $100 food and beverage credit because MGM messed up our room so I'm glad I didn't have to pay my own money. I'd prefer Golden Corral any day. This buffet is lacking flavor and variety
939	1	Ramsay's has become my new favorite steakhouse in Vegas.  The overall surroundings look similar to what it looked like when Les Artiste use to inhabit the location with the exception of a tunnel like hall and a lounge in the bar area where a large table use to exist.  The neon overhang is pretty cool too.  Excellent customer service is offered at Ramsay's.  I've been here twice now on two separate occasions with two different servers and I'm quite impressed.  My only warning for the newly initiated is that you just get plain tap water when they ask you for sparkling or still...$8 a pop otherwise.  On my first visit my table accidentally ordered bottle after bottle thinking the still water was plain water...NOT so.  Five bottles later...oh boy.  We might as well fork out for some more wine.  Great steaks.  The ribeye is my favorite but they have Kobe cuts that will melt in your mouth.  It's much pricier however, as is the caviar.  To save on price, order sides with your dish like the foie gras or bone marrow (no bread to neutralize the oiliness of the marrow however).  The main reason I like this place though is their toffee bread pudding (award winning according to our server)...YOU CANNOT MISS OUT ON THIS!  Save room for dessert.  Oh yeah, their complimentary bread is killer.  If you ask nicely they will pack you a few to go.
940	1	Came here late night a few nights ago and was really impressed. First of all they are open 24hrs which is awesome especially when you are partying all night. The place is really big and always pretty crowed which says something in itself. The staff is extremely friendly and very patient which is a plus. The food is great and they give you really big portions so come with an appetite. Overall the Peppermill was a great discovery for me and i would highly recommend it to any one looking for a late night or early morning eats.
941	1	Modern Korean bbq with a great selection of meats and appetizers. It's a mix between Korean and Japanese and the quality of the meat is much better than all you can eat. I recommend both the marinated and non marinated Kalbi for beef. Spicy garlic and calamari and spicy pork are also great. Close to the strip is well and much better than anything close by.
942	0	This buffet for me was just eh.  I came here for Christmas dinner and they had a different menu than normal.  In general, most of the things I ate were pretty overcooked.  The prime rib was dry as well as the turkey and other roasted meats.  The crab legs were okay if you got them fresh, but many of them were smaller and didn't really have much meat in it.  I saw the section of the buffet where you can customize pasta and they'll make it for you! I was super excited to try it, but unfortunately the pasta was bland and flavorless.  Salt made it slightly better.    The pan fried scallops looked great, but to my dismay, they were very overcooked and not tender at all.    Maybe I just came on the wrong day and most of their food happened to be overcooked.  Although I would expect the Christmas dinner to be of better quality.   The line to get in was pretty long as well and it seemed to be long most days that I walked by the buffet.   A couple good notes were that the service was decent and they have pineapple juice!
943	1	Dining at Bouchon is always a special treat! I have yet to have the pleasure of coming here for dinner, but I'm a big fan of their weekend brunch. I've celebrated my birthday here and took the day off from work to do so - which was totally worth it. They do not take reservations for brunch, so you have to come and give your name, but I've never waited too long. Even during my bachelorette party weekend, where they said the table for 8+ was 45 minutes, we got seated in 10 minutes. If there is a wait, they have a cute little seating area and usually pastries for you to sample. They have some daily specials, like a quiche of the day or soup of the day. Their quiches are perfectly soft and pillowy on the inside. I'm actually not a huge fan of their chicken & bacon chive waffles, but since everyone else raves about them, don't let my opinion stop you. One of my must orders is a side of fries - though I do wish they gave slightly bigger portions of ketchup and mayo, I always feel like such a classless fool when I have to ask for more. If you're with a larger group of people, the pastry basket is always a nice way to start off brunch as well while your entrees come in. I was so hungover and sick during the morning of my bachelorette weekend, I couldn't enjoy eating here. I sustained myself on ginger ale and their tasty cauliflower soup, while i watched everyone enjoy their mussels and steaks. I did have some of the foie gras that was ordered for the table - amazingly silky, and a big hit with all the Californians. I was so jealous of everyone's enjoyment, my husband and I ate here the next weekend so I could enjoy Bouchon like how it's meant to be enjoyed. I actually prefer sitting inside since it's beautifully decorated. The outside patio is right next to the pool and some bodies are just not meant to be looked at while you eat brunch. Their champagne cocktails are all really interesting, so you don't have to be basic and get a mimosa, there are a ton of other options. One of my favorite things to eat here is actually complimentary - I love eating their warm baguettes with the mustard on the table while my husband prefers spreading jam and butter on it.   I will  definitely be back here several more times and hopefully get to enjoy their dinner menu soon.
944	0	Not a good place to eat at all. We ordered 5 shrimp&pork egg rolls(didn't have any flavor at all) chicken wings(HIGHLY SALTED, very processed), Thai tea smoothie, and Bbq pork sandwich. All of our food was not good at all. The manager was extremely rude. I'm very surprised they are still in business.   I would not recommend this place at all.
945	1	Yummy! If you are going for breakfast get there early like opening time early or else you will have to wait. But the portions are so big that waiting helps the hunger which helps you eat more of your dish. I've tried the brown sugar banana pancake and it was the biggest prettiest pancake i've ever seen. I love that they have tangerine juice. My mom tried Andy's sage fried chicken and it was awesome! I have also tried their bacon waffle and i'm a fan. There are so many good items on the menu, so if it looks good try it. I recommend the kiwi watermelon lemonade!
946	1	Great food, fast and friendly service. Modern upbeat decor, privatish booths.  Honey bread took over 20 minutes, but was great - order ahead.  Close to the strip, across from the hard rock hotel and Hofbruhaus house (and kiss minigolf).  No frills, would be happy to go back anytime.
947	0	Enjoy the feeling of being packed like a can of sardines?  Have enough free time to wait in lines even after getting in?  Feel like bumping shoulders, elbows, while on the dance floor?  Like short bouncers with a Napolean complex?  Great!  This is the place for you then!  Pay an extravagant cover fee for the experience!  Thank goodness I didn't wait in the hour+ line and got in right away through hookups, otherwise it would've made the experience all the worst.
948	0	My first stay was so terrible that they gave me a free upgrade for my next trip. Just called to book it, and NOPE, they don't have those dates available. Screw this place. They don't care about keeping you happy, they don't care if you stay here. The room was horrible, as we could hear the garbage  men outside our window at 6am! Asked for non smoking room and got a smoking one. They wouldn't change it for us. They are in shambles. Go elsehwere
949	0	Was so happy when we were driving by and saw this Lee's Sandwiches in Vegas. But everything is more expensive at this location and service is so slow! All I ordered was iced coffee and it took a lot longer than it should. There was a long line and just one person at the register. Randomly the interior is pretty big though and they also sell self-serve frozen yogurt.
950	0	Food barn.  There is no ambiance to look at. Just carpeted floor, barely smiling hosts and mediocre food.  I don't think it's worth it even with the discount coupons. I would like to give this a higher rating but there is really nothing that stands out fromt heir offerings.  Cotton Candy and their Middle Eastern section is the only saving grace from another deduction.  Some say that there is quality. They may be eating from the floor then.   Sorry.
951	0	As soon as we walked in our room, the toilet was running constantly and would not flush. We called the front desk and waited an hour and nobody answered us. We decided to head out for a bit and when we got back we called the front desk again, waited a while and someone finally answered. We asked if we could change rooms and they said no. They said they would send a repair guy to fix the toilet, they did not apologize for the inconvenience.  When we got back that night the toilet was fixed. But the next morning as i went to take a nice shower, i could hardly keep my balance because there was water stuck under the bottom of the tub lining. I slipped a couple of times and so did my boyfriend. I can only imagine how much it must be rotting under there. There were also hand towels on top of the bathroom door and shower rod that were hard as a rock... Who knows how long they were there for.  Not to mention the sleepless nights because of young kids hanging out in the hallway, smoking and drinking and yelling for hours. Will NEVER stay there again.
952	1	High quality meat, extremely rich in flavor, great service, & a cute ambience. What more can you ask for? Our server suggested we try the gangnam style BBQ for our first time. From the starters to the dishes, you will not be disappointed! At the end of our meal, we still managed to squeeze in dessert, which was just as good. From the mochi ice cream to the lava cake to honey toast, everything here was on point. Definitely set the standards for Korean BBQ for me.
953	1	One platter can fill the needs of two hungry people. Three not so hungry people. A group of 5 for a snack.   Get liquor in your coffee starting at 7:30 am. I would suggest the Mexican coffee.   Loved the house smoked salmon w/ basil pesto, fresh tomato and melted brie cheese. Must get the french toast.
954	1	SO GOOD!! Tried it for the first time. Got white pizza for $5 and it was simply CHEESEY GOODNESS! They reheat the pizza for you so when you it's nice and crispy when you eat! Though this place isn't very secret anymore since the line gets pretty long, it's worth the wait! Perfect place to go after clubbing at Marquee since it's open til 5 am. There's not that much room for you to sit and eat inside, but there's a seating area right outside with a pool table. Definitely a good place to stop by in Cosmo!
955	1	Have eaten for over 20 years, and enjoyed it everytime. Breakfast or lunch, weekdays or weekends, its great! I visit Vegas 5+ times a year and have to stop each and everytime. Jennifer Martin, our waitress is always professional and fun. She has a great laugh and smile. Ask for her if you can, you wont be dissappointed.
956	0	$4 for stale, bagged chips and a small bowl of salsa.  Flat draft beer.  No enchiladas, chimichangas, or typical authentic Mexican dishes.   Extremely high priced for extremely subpar food.   So, go to 7Eleven, grab a six-pack (don't drink yet), and drive thru Taco Bell.  Then, take the $20 you saved and light it on fire. At least you're doing something better with that $20 than giving it to an overhyped, pathetic attempt at serving "food."
957	1	This was by far the best burger I've ever had!!! I ordered the Rising Sun Burger and the meat was SOOO moist!  I loved the teriyaki glaze, tempura avocado, and yam crisps.  Such an interesting and unique blend of flavors.  My boyfriend got the Campfire S'more Bam-Boozled Shake which was delicious and the Gold Standard Burger.  The burger was smokey and rich and the aged goat cheddar cheese, bacon and arugula brought it all together.    Holsteins will surely become our go-to amazing meal spot in Vegas.  SOOOOOOO good!  Why does it have to be so far away?
958	0	I used to visit this buffet pretty regularly because they HAD a keno board which there are only a few left on the strip. Now that it's gone there is no reason at all to eat here. The selection is eh, the food is eh and the price is the same as some of the better buffets on the strip. I will say that the service is pretty good. Unless you have a coupon for a free or very discounted buffet I would probably skip this one.
959	0	A group of us stopped in later in the night after a work convention ended. The place was pretty bare compared to the other eateries we checked out first. That should have been our first clue.   The food was mediocre at best. Out of the 5 of us, no one was impressed. In fact one of us didn't even touch the chicken to their chicken & waffles. I ordered the corned beef hash and I don't know what happened. Maybe being close to the casino, they figure everyone is drunk and looking for greesy food, or maybe the cook accidentally spilled the oil on my plate but I could tip my plate and watch the oil run off. I ended up eating enough so that I wasn't starving and left the rest.   The service was horrible. We were constantly out of water. Our waiters switched over shortly after sitting down and I think the new guy forgot about us. Once we ordered, it seemed like forever that we got our food but the worst was paying. We gave the waiter our money/cards and he took off for 25 minutes! We watched him service other tables while we waited to get our change or in my case, my credit card back. I'm sorry but I'm not comfortable with the fact that my credit card was sitting God knows where for that long. Needless to say, I've been vigilantly checking my account every day just to make sure.   Not worth the bad food or service. Look elsewhere.
960	1	Best burgur of my life.  I was so excited to eat here and it lived up to every expectation.  I'm so happy I was able to go here on my trip.  The quality of everything was so good.  The sweet potato fries and truffle oil fries are a must.  Hells kitchen burger was so good roasted tomatoes and jalapeos and avocado.  So good!  It's definitely a must if in Vegas.
961	1	Hands down, the best burger I've ever eaten.  I had the HK burger and my wife had the Brittania, and both of them were flat-out phenomenal.  "It's cooked beautifully" (in my best GR voice.  The servers are very attentive, the pricing isn't bad ($15 for this burger wasn't out of line, IMHO), and everything about the restaurant smacks of attention to detail.    Try the sweet potato fries.  Absolutely delicious.    This place is worth the wait.  You could also wait until after midnight, usually there's no line by then.
962	0	I spent years driving by wanting to try it. Last October I went for my birthday and I was super disappointed. White chocolate frozen hot choco was too sweet and the carrot cake sundae was mediocre. I went again last night in hopes that they were just having a bad night when I went the first time. But I was let down again. The chocolate blackout cake sundae was overwhelmingly sweet once again with no depth to the flavors what so ever. I would have gotten the same effect if I made my own at home with Hershey's chocolate sauce. When I am charged over $20 for cake and ice cream, I expect it to be pretty outstanding which Serendipity 3 just can't seem to do.

964	0	Its an ok, clean hotel...but the location kind of sucks and not quite up to some of the standards I've expereinced at other Westins. I mean, who goes to vegas to stay at the westin?  Unless you've stayed at every other hotel in town before (I have), I wouldn't recommend staying here on vacation.  For saving money, its fine....but I'd still prefer a strip hotel.
965	0	Ha!, someone beat me to "'More' should be called 'Less'", and it's no better a name than the previous "Pharoah's Pheces".  Starving farm cats would walk away from the fish-labeled material that could be used to keep cotton sweaters safe from moths.  The prime rib could be used for knock-off Hong Kong Coach purses or for a lower-quality line of leather products it was so tough and dry.  Luxor at least could start a line of Egyptian-themed dog rawhide chews with the "prime rib" from "More-bid".  The morbid, morose "More" chicken legs were not quite as moist as the turkey Chevy Chase cut into for Christmas Vacation.  If you didn't know drosophila melanogaster was the scientific name for fruit flies you will become an expert entomologist on the little suckers at the morbid, morose "More".  Those aren't black sesame seeds on your dessert.  Opt-in and consume the comparably yummy & authentic African dung beetles and opt-out for eating "More".  Yes, I did notify the Filipina waitress my wife was chatting with in Tagalog of the issues and they were not new.
966	0	Skip this place and go to Texas de Brazil! The food is mediocre and the quality of the meat here is not the best. The hot good in the salad bar area left a lot to desire.   If you pay extra for the seafood option you will regret it. We were with a large party and the waiter received at least $400 tip, way too much for the service he provided. Won't be back.
967	0	Came to Vegas for an all girls trip. My Bestie wanted to try their frozen hot chocolate. I have no idea what it was so i told her go ahead! the 5 of us shared 2 different ones (Original and Oreooo). it was 11 bucks each and the wait to order was over 20 minutes.   When we tried it, it was very very very very very disappointing. I felt like it just tasted like a milk shake, but some milk shakes taste even better... i don't know what the big fuss about it was. I was excited too, because i love dessert, but they were overly sweet and not special at all.  I am glad we split it and didn't decide to buy one on our own....  I will not be back from any more frozen hot chocolate, maybe for something else.  =]
968	0	They really need to re-evaluate on having a buffet.   With so much history, at the MGM Grand and this is what they have to offer. It's rather disappointing and I would say the worst buffet in Vegas I've had in the 10 years I've been coming to Vegas. Either they don't listen to the reviews or they just don't care. To me it's ruining MGM's image and unacceptable.  The food quality is below par with the exception of the desserts which is slightly better. Everthing was either overcooked, or dry. The atmosphere reminds me one of those $11.99 Chinese buffet. Never again.
969	1	heard that Anthony Bourdain had visited so we stopped by on recent trip to Vegas. AMAZING food. and even more amazing wine list. both pretty surprising given nondescript location and underwhelming exterior. be sure to order something you have never had before to take advantage of the regional specialities offered that you won't see anywhere else.
970	1	I LOVE Burger Bar. So much. As a local, I really try to avoid the Strip as much as possible. But this place has become a staple in my family. When we think burgers, we think Burger Bar...so it's well worth the drive down the Strip to get there.  Depending on when you go dictates how long the wait is. We've waited anywhere from 10 minutes to over an hour. They won't seat you unless everyone in your party is present (which I can appreciate, having worked in the restaurant industry), so if you're waiting for people to arrive, I recommend at least getting your name on the list. That way, when everyone DOES arrive, you can just let the hostess know your party is ready and your wait time will be shortened.  It's usually pretty loud in there. If you're looking for a quiet meal, this definitely isn't the place to go. It's got a bit of a sports bar feel to it, with sports games playing on both the big screens and the small TV screens inside the booths. But everybody always seems to be having a good time, and I can still manage to have a conversation with my table without having to shout at anybody.  They have the Chef's burgers menu, and also have build-your-own options for burgers and milkshakes (both alcoholic and not). They have non-beef options, such as chicken, turkey, or salmon. They even have a veggie burger and a specialty vegan burger, along with various salad options for all the non-meat eaters out there. All of the Chef's burgers come with skinny fries, but you can change those out for any of their other side options. (I usually opt for sweet potato fries.) If you do a build-your-own, you can add on those side options for $3-6.  I personally am OBSESSED with the Hubert Keller burger. I mean, I dream about this burger. I wake up craving it. And then I bug everyone I know to give me an excuse to go get one. It's a buffalo burger topped with sauteed baby spinach, caramelized onions, and blue cheese. Each component on that burger compliments every other component. It comes with a Red Wine Shallot reduction on the side, and it just puts the burger over the top. It took a couple visits for me to get my dad to try it (he was scared of buffalo meat for some reason), but I practically shoved a bite down his throat and now he's hooked. Buffalo meat is amazing!  A close second (in my opinion) would have to be the Peppercorn burger. If you're a fan of pepper and mustard, THIS is the burger for you.  Then of course, there are the milkshakes. Holy crap! So yummy! I've had both the Nutella and the Salted Caramel milkshakes. Both are sooo delicious. When ordering shakes "for here" they are decorated beautifully. Very artistic. But you can also order them to-go, and they'll put it in a plastic cup with a nice wide straw so you can take it with you.   I also recommend the Creamy Cheese Cake burger. This is a dessert alternative to the milkshake, filled with sweetened cream cheese and caramelized pineapple. The "bun" is made with fresh donuts! Mmm Mmm! They're a little small though, so...unless you just want a bite, I recommend skipping the "Let's split a dessert" part of the conversation and just keep it all to yourself.  We've never once had a bad experience here. Our servers have always been friendly, they are mindful of any modifications we make, and our burgers are always cooked to perfection. Service CAN be a little slow though. Depending on how busy they are, it may be hard to track down said server for drink refills or extra sauce. And once they take your order, you can expect to be sitting there twiddling your thumbs for 15-20 minutes with nothing on the table but beverages. (There is also a longer wait on the dessert burgers.) But! They DO cook everything to order, so it's completely understandable and well worth that wait.
971	1	Came with a group for dinner (Burger for dinner, really?). However, I got the $24 Huber Keller burger (Buffalo meat, Caramelized onion, baby spinach and blue cheese on a Ciabatta Bun. Served with red wine and shallot sauce) and a side of onion rings (substitute for skinny fries) and it was the best burger I ever had - hands down.  With a glass of red wine - heaven.
972	1	I went here with high hopes and was not in the slightest bit disappointed. The waitstaff was very helpful and polite. Our waiter brought by a cart of meat to show us the cuts and explained them to us. We were started with a variety of breads served with smoked salt butter. They were terrific. I ordered the filet and it was great. I've been to other steakhouses and this was to die for. Had haricot vert on the side. It was tempura fried but a little greasy. Probably wouldn't order it again, but it wasn't terrible. Also had the creamed spinach on the side which was pretty good. I almost died and went to heaven when I was served dessert. I ordered the sticky toffee pudding and it was the best thing I've EVER eaten. I would go back a million times just to eat this dessert!!! I left here stuffed full but wanting to eat more! Will definitely go back in the future.
973	1	I did my research on this place and did the whole only order from the back side of the menu with all of the northern specialties. And holy moly. Those garlic prawns were AMAZING. I forever will need them in my life and have been ruined for all other crispy, garlicky, Heaven infused crustaceans. The crispy duck with curry was also a favorite, I could eat that daily. I'm so coming back here everytime I'm in vegas. I'm addicted.
974	1	Love the texture of the crust and the constantly different kind of pizza popping out of there oven. W were the first one to get there.  Ordered a slice of pepperoni and a slice of sausage and peppercino. Then went back after that a split a slice of a different kind of sausage and ricotta pizza. Big groups I recommend maybe getting a whole pie and customizing it.
975	1	We knew that this trip, we needed to try Lotus.  We tried for dinner on a Thursday night and wait was 1.5 hours, reservations for dinner were booked a week out :( the host suggested we come back when they open at 11. Lunch is first come first serve. Flash forward to Friday morning, we show up about 11:05 and there were about 4 tables already sat and a steady stream of tables after us. I got the drunken noodle prawn off the chefs recommendation , the FI got a street vendor special that was on the northern specialty menu and we go the #14 appetizer that our waiter suggested.  No joke, best Thai food we've had. The originality the menu had, the last 4 pages...that's what you come here for. Slap yourself if you get Pad Thai.... Food has major flavor....like an explosion of spice and heat and layer upon layer of it. Oh man....yep. that good.
976	0	I would give it a zero if I knew how! Worst service ever! As a server myself, I've never seen such disregard to a customer. Never once saw our serve once he took our order til we had to ask someone else for the check. Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES! Acted like they were too good to work! And worst the chicken from the chicken and waffles was undeniable! Never order that ugh!
977	1	Good food, good vibes, & great customer service! I will come back here again. The bulgogi is very good! I really like the kimchi, it flakes the rice. The beef toro is amazing when you dip it in the sauces.   Happy hour is amazing. You can get meats up to $4 a plate!
978	0	It was husbands pick.  Heard about the lines on opening day so I was worried that it might be crowded but alas it was not at all and I can see why.  It is connected to the Casino Royale but has its own store front so you literally pass it when walking on the strip.  You can see and hear slots in the dining room.   I've tried them in the frozen aisle before and ended up tossing the rest of the box because I thought they were awful then.  I was hoping that maybe getting it fresh would make a difference.  UM, no.  They were pretty awful.  Patty is thin as paper with no flavor.  Bread is soft and soggy.  Price was also a lot for the quality you get.  $7.99 for 4 sliders, ordinary crinkle fries and a drink but it could be because they are on the strip.  Even my husband was not crazy about them either.  It was good enough to try once but I won't be coming back.  I just don't get the fascination?  Give me In and Out Burger anyday.  Heck even Burger King beats it and I can't stand Burger King.  They get an extra star for friendly staff. As for the complaint about the trays, that is the least of their problem.  The whole thing was so bland.  Would be good for kids.
979	0	My husband and I decided to play "tourist" on the Memorial Day weekend.  We started to Planet Hollywood's Miracle Mile Shops.  While walking thru the shops, we decided to share a yard margarita.  (If we wanted to play tourists, we had to look the part!)  Fat Tuesdays had a line down the hall and around the corner!  So we thought we'd see what else was in the shops.  We thought we were lucky because just as we were about to walk out of the shops, Cabo Wabo Cantina appears with a margarita/daiquiri stand.  We end up getting the  1/2 yard with a strawberry margarita.  The first couple sips, neither of us said anything.  I didn't care for the drink so I stopped drinking it.  About 2 minutes later, my husband looks at me and says "Doesn't this taste a little funny?"   Yes!  It tasted like a watered down slushie/virgin margarita!  We decided to salvage the drink...went to ABC Store, bought Bacardi's Cherry flavor and poured a couple shots in there.  It tasted much better after that.  All and all...the drink cost over $30 (between the cost of the  1/2 yard at Cabo Wabo, tip, and ABC liquor purchase).  Will we go back?  Heck NO!  I'll wait in line at Fat Tuesdays or skip the drink next time.  PS:  This struck me as very strange....Our server at Cabo Wabo was counting her tips.  And not just quickly going thru the cash and then waiting on us.  She was pretending to be interested in us while she was counting out her money.  We told her our drink order and she gave us the "deer in the headlights" look with a blank smile!  She wasn't paying attention to one word we said!  We repeated our order, she recounted her money then got us our drink.  Not sure why it was so important to count her money so intensely but it was kinda weird!
980	0	Came here with some friends and my husband for brunch and we were disappointed. The only thing I enjoyed was my corned beef hash. Our waitress was cold and short with us, the food was just ok and the prices were way too high! I realize these are fairly large portions but the quality of the food was lacking thus didn't deserve to be this expensive. My friends wanted to go here because they ate here 4 yrs ago and loved it. They were disappointed as well.
981	1	As a few Yelpers have noted in previous posts, the actual name of the pizzeria is Nico's, but I will always remember it as "Secret Pizza".When you walk by, it's easy to miss. But take the time and enjoy the many record album covers that adorn the walls. I busted a gut, for sure. That hallway will lead you to a pinball machine and voil!, you've found your pot of gold.   Staying at the Cosmo, my husband and I decided to take full use of our amazing room and bask in the glory of pizza on our balcony overlooking the Bellagio water show. In about twenty minutes, our pizza was ready and we were on that elevator so fast. The pizza was very good and a nice break from formal dining on the Strip. Highly recommended for those general hankerings for pizza in Vegas.
982	0	Very unhappy with this buffet. They claim the "Best buffet in America". WOW, I certainly hope not.  Seafood spectacular was anything but.  4 items do make a spectacular, two of which were fried shrimp.  Up side: for $12 the food was tolerable.  DOWN SIDE: place was filthy. Food everywhere on floor, ground into the carpet - we were there for just over an hour and NO ONE cleaned the carpet even once.  Were they busy? Thursday about 6 pm, Steady business. Is this acceptable? NO. Having been in the business for over 25 yrs.- including  a busy buffet, I find this completly unacceptable. On the food line, at least 1/2 the items were empty the several times I walked the line.  All the cooks did seem to be enjoying  themselves rather than tending  to the line. The server was overwhelmed  by 28-4 tops that she was attempting to attend to by herself.  Staff training seemed to be non-existent as the busboy, when he finally showed up, seemed to have had no training at all. So: food - **; Service: Jenny- ****; Cleanliness - 0*.  I, personally will go hungry before considering this as a place to eat.
983	1	What do you do when you are damn hungry and want to eat really tasty food somewhere on The Strip at 02:00 hrs? Well, you go to Grand Lux Cafe :)  I was staying in Venetian with my wife and was looking for some food joint near by. Grand Lux Cafe came to our mind since we liked the complimentary breakfast here. We ordered  Veggie Burger, Margarita Pizza and Garden Omelette. Here is what we liked about this cafe: 1. Food was just awesome. It was so tasty that we ended up eating a lot more  2. Serving size was much more than we expected(at least if I compare that to Gordon Ramsay Burgr)  3. Ambience is really really good  4. It is not costly at all  5. Wide variety of options to choose from. Me and my wife are eggetarian and even we could find sufficient number of options to choose from  6. It is open 24 hrs  Something not to miss in Vegas !
984	0	This was a terrible experience for us. Probably the worst service I have EVER had. Luckily we had a groupon so it cut the price down, but we sat at our table for almost 20 minutes before our server ever came by to take our order and let us know how it worked. ( We didn't know to just go to the salad bar.) WE then ordered our drinks which took another 15-20 minutes. The meat servers were ok, but we had to ask for Pork, and we never got any of some of the other things. Now mind you it was lunch time, so not super busy. I can't imagine how bad it would be if they were busy. servers would just walk right past you and ignore you. We had servers helping people RIGHT next to us and well as just a few tables away. Even some of them complained about the level or lack of service. After over an hour, we finally had to flag someone down and ask them about our dessert we were supposed to receive with our meal, and told them we would need it to go since they took so long. IF I was the owner or manager, I would be taking a hard look at what is happening in my restaurant. FOr as expensive as this restaurant is, the service should be top notch. I get better help at Mc Donalds. Don't waste your time find another Braziliian steak house.
985	0	You're definitely getting what you pay for here, so it wouldn't make sense to give this place 1 star. I'll just say it's basically a Motel 6 with some wood paneling, and a homeless guy kept knocking on my door to chat with me. Oh yeah, and the waitress totally forgot about us.
986	0	MGM Grand Hotel was one of my favorite Casino in Las Vegas.  Now I have to change my mind.  There Hotel service is way down and checking in takes way too long.  MGM I will keep my business with your family Casino line Aria and Etc.  But I don't think I will be stay in MGM Grand Hotel anymore.  Very disappointed!
987	0	Pricey for mediocre food.  The service our group of 6 had was pretty reasonable.  My biggest gripe about this place is that you have to PAY for chips and salsa.  It's not cheap either.  In addition, we got the guacamole.  We were so excited to get a bowl full of guac only to realize the bottom of it was a bunch of crushed chips so that [as our waitress explained] you don't drag your fingers through the guac.  Uh...whatever.  All of us ordered burritos.  I got the veggie burrito although I'm not vegetarian.  It was mostly filled with sauteed onions with a bell pepper here and there.  Overall, not the biggest fan of the food.  Of course with any restaurant along the strip, it wasn't cheap ($9 for a small burrito).  I will admit the salsa and hot sauce were amazing but such a rip off.  This is a fun place to drink but when you drink you want snacks...so just expect to shell out a pretty penny or 100.  [haha?]
988	1	This is my second time visiting and it's awesome! I had the Hell's Kitchen burger cooked medium well.  Great choice if you like spicy food. It's really good! We also had the truffle Parmesan fries.....so good!! This time I had room for dessert and got Shake #3.... OMG so delicious. StafThe only thing is a downside is the wait other than that everything is good. I still give it 5 stars despite the wait!
989	1	The only negative thing I can say is that THERE ISN'T ONE OF THESE NEAR MY HOME. :,( I'm distraught that this is the only one of these restaurants that exists. My heart yearns for it. I'm broken without it. I can't... I can't handle being away from it...  /end dramatic cold open.  Seriously, as someone who's eaten well over 100 unique burgers, this is in my top 3. EVER. And it's not just because my friend and I walked in piss drunk. We weren't really -that- drunk, but very hungry, nonetheless.  We shared a spiked Cap'n Crunch milkshake which I thought was the greatest thing ever. I'm onto these places starting to get all hip with their cereal malts. I'm down with it.  I had the Fun-Ghi burger and... okay, wait... I need to breathe. Okay, I'm good. I think. BE STILL, MY BEATING HEART. Jesus Christ. Okay, I'm back.  I was just flabbergasted at how well-prepared and tasty every single bite of this burger was. There's just nothing more I can say about it. Every single ingredient was prepared well and all the flavors complemented each other and there were just perfect amounts of everything and was just really satisfying to eat.  The fries were also very good. I personally thought, that, for the price and in a place like this on the strip, it was a good deal. You can easily be paying $20+ for a crappier meal on the strip.  I also liked the atmosphere and all the artwork they have hanging around, and our waiter was AWESOME. He got a large tip. He knew he what he was doing, though. He was knowledgeable, friendly, and quick - we were out of there in under an hour, around DINNER TIME. It was seriously one of the most pleasant meals I've had in my entire life, and since I've been here I've contemplated going back to Vegas just for a night or two and eating here. I swear by it. Eat here. Please.
990	0	The only reason they are getting two stars is because the portions are huge. Other than that, the place is overrated. From the time we sat down, it took 40 minutes to get some of our food- my husband and I waited another 15 minutes to receive ours. The food wasn't great- it was OK. The only reason we came here was because we found a groupon. Unfortunately I felt like it was a waste of money. There are much much better places on the strip to grab breakfast.
991	0	The ONLY reason I am giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because they do have pretty good sushi.  HOWEVER - the hype about this place is so overdone that the staff has a huge attitude and they do not know how to treat guests.    My husband and I went around 7:30 on a Thursday night.  We were staying at the Venetian (the hotel connected to the restaurant), made reservations for both the restaurant and the nightclub.  After waiting an HOUR we finally got a table.  The place was dark, loud, and the layout made you feel very crowded.  It was difficult to see what we were eating, let alone have a conversation.  We dropped about $400 on dinner (we were celebrating and had a bottle of Veuve).    After dinner was over, we said we had reservations for the nightclub, the entrance to the club was literally 20 feet from our table.  Well, we had to get up, go outside the club, stand in a long "special line" and then wait in another "special line" in order to pay a $20 cover to go back through the restaurant we just left, back up the stairs we just came down, in order to get in.    Pathetic.    When we got inside, it got even worse.  The place was packed (it was only 10:30 p.m.!).  The bouncers were rude, the place was pitch black in some places - so it was a lot of bumping into people.  I would estimate that about 80% of every room in the entire club was sectioned off for VIP.  So unless you are ready to drop $300 on a $40 bottle of vodka, don't expect to have any room.
992	1	We absolutely ADORED this place! Everything was delicious. There was no wait & our server was on top of her game. We had a party of 5 & enjoyed corned beef hash, tostada bowl, omelettes, French toast & a few carafes of coffee. Their muffins are hot, moist and delicious & their salsa is amazing! I'm not sure what they do their potatoes, but best we ever had! Such a gem! We will be back as soon as we touch down in Vegas again.
993	1	This place was beautiful and amazing Doug and Alberto were my servers and they were positive and kind best thing is they were genuinely happy to be there and that's a huge deal to me when someone is serving my food. I sat outside and O M G the scenery! Such a pleasant well decorated garden and everyone around just in a good mood. The food was awesome I had the quiche!!!!! You have to try I've never had it like that before and it was the best quiche I've ever had. Period. So happy I came amazing and relaxing experience and non expensive I paid $30 for quiche side of spinach bowl of fruit fresh orange juice tp and side of hot tea. Can't be that especially for the awesome location
994	1	This is a good burger place, they have good fries and good variety of foods also. I did not try their shakes but plan to in the future, they are fast to get your order and have your food up faster than other places on the strip! I want to try other foods. Good fun place to eat with family and reasonably priced!
995	1	Best Korean food in Vegas....PSY would agree!!! My brother and I ordered the Meat Lover and a side of romain lettuce...we are both big eaters and still had food left over!!  Free dessert was a bonus!!  Make rezzies as we waited 1.5 hours on a Wednesday!  Worth the wait though!!
996	0	The sports book and buffet here are great and gambling is cheap during the morning but I will never stay here again... first they charge you 20 dollar a day resort fee THEN if you want to use the weight room you have to pay ANOTHER 20 DOLLARS A DAY!!!! sorry but no other hotel has ever charged 2 resort fees for two different gym AT THE SAME HOTEL!!!! lvh love your sports book but ill never stay here again the rooms are ok but I can pay a cheaper resort fee and hotel rate else where and it will be better
997	1	Pro: Cheesecake factory done right, TONS of seats, great food, excellent breakfast buffet. 24 hours!!!  Con: Back of the Venetian, can still be crowded during major conventions.  This is it, skip all your buffets and $150 dollar per person meals, come here and dine. The menu is long and detailed, from small to epic portions, everything is done right from 6 am to 9 pm. I have personally ate here 3 times while in those ungodly hours and everything is just done to perfection.   The breakfast buffet is a quick service option, most time is when my crew are here for CES, skip the wait, and go get your own food. The fruit is always the highlight, it's just better than the $33 dollars Caeser/Aria buffet.   If the place is packed, go eat at the bar, the service there is sometimes better.
998	1	Server (Dave) was really nice and explained to us the portions before ordering.  We ordered the meat lover for 4 people and we had a lot of left overs with 5 people eating. Dave was honest and all the waiters/waitresses helped one another with their tables.  Great service and food.  Don't forget to leave a review for free ice cream
999	0	Let me get to the point right now... DO NOT EAT HERE!  This was a BOMB from start to finish and a complete waste of $157.00 for 4 people.  We made reservations.  When we showed up the hostess tried to put us outside where everyone walks by you. We noticed that's whereshe tries to put everyone initially. It's obviously is an effort to gain attention of by-passers, who think "wow, let's eat here, it's so busy".   It's very impersonal area, so we said we will sit inside.  So now she makes us wait for like 7+ minutes.  The inside was nearly empty and we still waited.  The waitress looked "frazzled" that we choise to eat inside.  So she seats us next to an entry way like a thoroughfare, but this place is nearly empty.  Many nice tables available.  Then we waited nearly 10 minutes for someone to say "hi" I'm your waiter/waitress.  We were just ready to leave this place when out of the blue, a waitress greets us with a really bad vibe, unhappy feeling, impersonable to say the least.  So I order the unlimited meat thing for $37.95 or close to that price.  Well to keep this short, the meat carving people DO NOT make their rounds consistently.  They leave you waiting for more than 10-15 minutes at a time before another meat arrives.  I sat there looking around thinking what the heck is going on here?  Then someone shows up.  You can feel the reluctancy to carve you any decent sized portion.  Then you wait 10-15 minutes... another person comes, you get the picture???  One of my guests had a halibut fish at $27.99.  It was sadly the size of a king-sized pack of cigarettes, with some steamed veggies and that was a bit dry.  This was a let down.  My wife's dish was a lobster bouilliabaise.  The dish was mediocre, the tiny shrimp you had to find in the soup, the mussels were so tiny that I cant believe they would serve that!  The pasta was overcooked.  They only served me 5  types of meat while there. The filet mignon was the only one I could comfortably chew.  The rest of the meat was not very tender and tasty.  We over-heard our waitress complaining to another one saying the meat service is affecting her tips.   Yes it does, and so does her crappy personality.  Let me tell all of you that read this.  This place survives, thanks to the countless tourist turn-over.  This place is so desperate, they hand-out discount coupons in front of their place to the people that walk by....if you walk in because you wanted to anyhow, no discount coupon offer for you!   Plus take in mind my earlier comment about how thay want you to sit out front so they can market you to other suckers walking by. This place is no better than an average dinner buffet for $12.95.  I should have payed attention to the other Yelper comments out there, and I got burned.  Oh yeah, our seats were badly covered in grease drippings and other spills left behind from customers.  Gross!  One last thing, when we left, we walked by a hostess or a waitress who was using a company computer moniter station area  to check her FaceBook photos.... "class act" here people.  You can see, this place is a BOMB from start to finish.  Take my advice.... and others.... just pass over this place, it should close it's doors... for good.
